10064839|t|Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.
10064839|a|Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects. The mechanisms of these CNS effects of DM have been suggested to be associated with the low-affinity, noncompetitive, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism of DM and/or the high-affinity DM/sigma receptors. DM is largely O-demethylated into the phencyclidine (PCP)-like compound dextrorphan (DR), which may limit its therapeutic use by producing PCP-like adverse effects, such as hyperlocomotion. Dimemorfan ((+)-3-methyl-N-methylmorphinan, DF), an analog of DM, which has been safely used as an antitussive for more than 20 years, is also known not to form DR. This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR. We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM). Only DR exhibited moderate affinity for PCP sites (Ki=0.9 microM), whereas DF (Ki=17 microM) and DM (Ki=7 microM) were much less active. DF, DM and DR produced prominent anticonvulsant effects in mice as measured by the supramaximal electroshock test with comparable potency (ED50 approximately 70 micromol/kg, i.p.). At the tested doses (20-260 micromol/kg, i.p.), DM and DR exhibited biphasic effects on the locomotor activity whereas DF produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease. These results revealed that, unlike DM and DR, DF did not cause a PCP-like hyperlocomotion adverse effect that is parallel with the PCP sites binding data. Furthermore, since they have equipotent anticonvulsant effects and similar binding affinities to sigma-1 receptors, the very low affinity of DF at PCP sites may suggest that acting on the PCP sites may not be the requisite for mediating the anticonvulsant activity of these DM analogs. With the history of safety and relative less adverse effects, DF appears to be worth further studying on its CNS effects other than the antitussive effect.

10082498|t|Angiotensin II receptor blockade in normotensive subjects: A direct comparison of three AT1 receptor antagonists.
10082498|a|Use of angiotensin (Ang) II AT1 receptor antagonists for treatment of hypertension is rapidly increasing, yet direct comparisons of the relative efficacy of antagonists to block the renin-angiotensin system in humans are lacking. In this study, the Ang II receptor blockade induced by the recommended starting dose of 3 antagonists was evaluated in normotensive subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 4-way crossover study. At 1-week intervals, 12 subjects received a single dose of losartan (50 mg), valsartan (80 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), or placebo. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed before and 4, 24, and 30 hours after drug intake by 3 independent methods: inhibition of the blood pressure response to exogenous Ang II, in vitro Ang II receptor assay, and reactive changes in plasma Ang II levels. At 4 hours, losartan blocked 43% of the Ang II-induced systolic blood pressure increase; valsartan, 51%; and irbesartan, 88% (P<0.01 between drugs). The effect of each drug declined with time. At 24 hours, a residual effect was found with all 3 drugs, but at 30 hours, only irbesartan induced a marked, significant blockade versus placebo. Similar results were obtained when Ang II receptor blockade was assessed with an in vitro receptor assay and by the reactive rise in plasma Ang II levels. This study thus demonstrates that the first administration of the recommended starting dose of irbesartan induces a greater and longer lasting Ang II receptor blockade than that of valsartan and losartan in normotensive subjects.

10193663|t|Characterisation of the 5-HT receptor binding profile of eletriptan and kinetics of [3H]eletriptan binding at human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
10193663|a|The affinity of eletriptan ((R)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-5-[2-(phenylsulphonyl )ethyl]-1H-indole) for a range of 5-HT receptors was compared to values obtained for other 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists known to be effective in the treatment of migraine. Eletriptan, like sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan and rizatriptan had highest affinity for the human 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and putative 5-ht1f receptor. Kinetic studies comparing the binding of [3H]eletriptan and [3H]sumatriptan to the human recombinant 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors expressed in HeLa cells revealed that both radioligands bound with high specificity (>90%) and reached equilibrium within 10-15 min. However, [3H]eletriptan had over 6-fold higher affinity than [3H]sumatriptan at the 5-HT1D receptor (K(D)): 0.92 and 6.58 nM, respectively) and over 3-fold higher affinity than [3H]sumatriptan at the 5-HT1B receptor (K(D): 3.14 and 11.07 nM, respectively). Association and dissociation rates for both radioligands could only be accurately determined at the 5-HT1D receptor and then only at 4 degrees C. At this temperature, [3H]eletriptan had a significantly (P<0.05) faster association rate (K(on) 0.249 min(-1) nM(-1)) than [3H]sumatriptan (K(on) 0.024 min(-1) nM(-1)) and a significantly (P<0.05) slower off-rate (K(off) 0.027 min(-1) compared to 0.037 min(-1) for [3H]sumatriptan). These data indicate that eletriptan is a potent ligand at the human 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-ht1f receptors and are consistent with its potent vasoconstrictor activity and use as a drug for the acute treatment of migraine headache.

10193665|t|Pharmacological profile of neuroleptics at human monoamine transporters.
10193665|a|Using radioligand binding techniques, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) for 37 neuroleptics and one metabolite of a neuroleptic (haloperidol metabolite) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with [3H]imipramine, [3H]nisoxetine, and [3H]WIN35428, respectively. Among neuroleptics, the four most potent compounds at the human serotonin transporter were triflupromazine, fluperlapine, chlorpromazine, and ziprasidone (K(D) 24-39 nM); and at the norepinephrine transporter, chlorpromazine, zotepine, chlorprothixene, and promazine (K(D) 19-25 nM). At the human dopamine transporter, only pimozide (K(D) = 69+/-3) ziprasidone (K(D) = 76+/-5) had notable potency. These data may be useful in predicting therapeutic and adverse effects, including drug interactions of neuroleptics.

10226872|t|Disodium cromoglycate does not prevent terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular in vivo functions in human volunteers.
10226872|a|In humans, prolonged administration of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular responses, which can be blunted by concomitant administration of the antianaphylactic drug ketotifen. This study investigated the effect of disodium cromoglycate, another antiallergic drug, on terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular responses. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, nine healthy male volunteers received disodium cromoglycate (4 x 200 mg/day, p.o.) or placebo for 3 weeks with terbutaline (3 x 5 mg/day, p.o.) administered concomitantly during the last 2 weeks. beta 2-Adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by the increase in heart rate and reduction of diastolic blood pressure induced by an incremental intravenous infusion of the unselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline; beta 1-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by exercise-induced tachycardia. Tremulousness was monitored as a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular effect. After 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline, there was a marked and significant (p < 0.001) attenuation of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia (mean percentage attenuation, 53.3%) and of the isoprenaline-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure (mean percentage attenuation, 55.6%). Exercise-induced tachycardia also was significantly (p < 0.001) blunted, but the magnitude of this attenuation was only very small (mean attenuation, 5.6%). Disodium cromoglycate affected neither the rightward shift of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses nor the small rightward shift in beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated exercise tachycardia after 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline. Tremulousness observed during the first few days of terbutaline administration disappeared after 4 to 8 days, indicating development of desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular responses. This was not prevented by disodium cromoglycate. These results confirm that long-term beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular effects in humans in vivo. However, unlike ketotifen, cromolyn sodium is not able to attenuate this desensitization.

10362188|t|A multicenter, randomized study of argatroban versus heparin as adjunct to tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in acute myocardial infarction: myocardial infarction with novastan and TPA (MINT) study.
10362188|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of a small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, on reperfusion induced by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Thrombin plays a crucial role in thrombosis and thrombolysis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that argatroban has advantages over heparin for the inhibition of clot-bound thrombin and for the enhancement of thrombolysis with TPA. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five patients with AMI within 6 h were randomized to heparin, low-dose argatroban or high-dose argatroban in addition to TPA. The primary end point was the rate of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 90 min. RESULTS: TIMI grade 3 flow was achieved in 42.1% of heparin, 56.8% of low-dose argatroban (p = 0.20 vs. heparin) and 58.7% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.13 vs. heparin). In patients presenting after 3 h, TIMI grade 3 flow was significantly more frequent in high-dose argatroban versus heparin patients: 57.1% versus 20.0% (p = 0.03 vs. heparin). Major bleeding was observed in 10.0% of heparin, and in 2.6% and 4.3% of low-dose and high-dose argatroban patients, respectively. The composite of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure, revascularization and recurrent ischemia at 30 days occurred in 37.5% of heparin, 32.0% of low-dose argatroban and 25.5% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Argatroban, as compared with heparin, appears to enhance reperfusion with TPA in patients with AMI, particularly in those patients with delayed presentation. The incidences of major bleeding and adverse clinical outcome were lower in the patients receiving argatroban.

10373224|t|Mechanistic differences of various AT1-receptor blockers in isolated vessels of different origin.
10373224|a|The functional inhibitory characteristics of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) candesartan; irbesartan; and losartan and its active metabolite EXP 3174 (EXP) were studied in rabbit aortic strips and rat portal vein preparations in vitro. Moreover, plasma-protein binding was determined, and the binding was high (>98. 5%) for all ARBs. These values were needed to relate the concentrations of the ARBs used in vitro to the nonprotein bound concentrations in clinical use. In both vascular preparations, candesartan caused a marked decrease in the maximal contractile response of the angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration-response curve. Losartan, EXP, and irbesartan caused a rightward parallel shift without any major effects on the maximal response to Ang II. The inhibitory effect of candesartan developed slowly (maximal effect after >30 minutes) and lasted >2 hours despite repeated washing of the vessels. The effect of losartan, irbesartan, and EXP had a faster onset, and most of the inhibitory effect disappeared after washing. The duration of the inhibitory effects of the ARBs were not related to lipophilicity of the compounds. Cooling of the rat portal vein preparations to 4 degrees C before administration of candesartan prevented the persistent inhibition of Ang II response seen at 37 degrees C. For the other ARBs studied, the magnitude of inhibition and the speed of recovery of the Ang II response were independent of the incubation temperature before washing. In addition, when candesartan was given to conscious rats, the inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced blood pressure responses persisted during the 24-hour period despite nondetectable plasma concentrations of candesartan at 24 hours. It is concluded that functional inhibitory characteristics of candesartan differ from those of the other ARBs tested. At clinically relevant concentrations, candesartan is an insurmountable and long-lasting antagonist of the vascular contractile responses to Ang II.

10381787|t|Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 and monocyte cyclooxygenase-2 by meloxicam in healthy subjects.
10381787|a|We evaluated whether therapeutic blood levels of meloxicam are associated with selective inhibition of monocyte cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in vitro and ex vivo. Concentration-response curves for the inhibition of monocyte COX-2 and platelet COX-1 were obtained in vitro after the incubation of meloxicam with whole blood samples. Moreover, 11 healthy volunteers received placebo or 7.5 or 15 mg/day meloxicam, each treatment for 7 consecutive days, according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Before dosing and 24 h after the seventh dose of each regimen, heparinized whole blood samples were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (10 microgram/ml) for 24 h at 37 degrees C, and prostaglandin E2 was measured in plasma as an index of monocyte COX-2 activity. The production of thromboxane B2 in whole blood allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 60 min was assessed as an index of platelet COX-1 activity. The administration of placebo did not significantly affect plasma prostaglandin E2 (21. 3 +/- 7.5 versus 19.1 +/- 4 ng/ml, mean +/- S.D., n = 11) or serum thromboxane B2 (426 +/- 167 versus 425 +/- 150 ng/ml) levels. In contrast, the administration of 7.5 and 15 mg of meloxicam caused dose-dependent reductions in monocyte COX-2 activity by 51% and 70%, respectively, and in platelet COX-1 activity by 25% and 35%, respectively. Although the IC50 value of meloxicam for inhibition of COX-1 was 10-fold higher than the IC50 value of COX-2 in vitro, this biochemical selectivity was inadequate to clearly separate the effects of meloxicam on the two isozymes after oral dosing as a function of the daily dose and interindividual variation in steady-state plasma levels.

10432475|t|Modulation of dialysate levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin (5-HT) in the frontal cortex of freely-moving rats by (-)-pindolol alone and in association with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors: comparative roles of beta-adrenergic, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B receptors.
10432475|a|(-)-Pindolol, which possesses significant affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and beta 1/2-adrenergic receptors (AR)s, dose-dependently increased extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NAD) versus 5-HT, in dialysates of the frontal cortex (FCX), but not accumbens and striatum, of freely-moving rats. In distinction, the preferential beta 1-AR antagonist, betaxolol, and the preferential beta 2-AR antagonist, ICI118,551, did not increase basal levels of DA, NAD, or 5-HT. Further, they both dose-dependently and markedly blunted the influence of (-)-pindolol upon DA and NAD levels. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100,635, slightly attenuated the (-)-pindolol-induced increase in DA and NAD levels, while the selective 5-HT1B antagonist, SB224,289, was ineffective. These data suggest that (-)-pindolol facilitates frontocortical dopaminergic (and adrenergic) transmission primarily by activation of beta 1/2-ARs and, to a lesser degree, by stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors, whereas 5-HT1B receptors are not involved. (-)-Pindolol potentiated the increase in FCX levels of 5-HT elicited by the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and duloxetine, and also enhanced their ability to elevate FCX levels of DA--though not of NAD. In contrast to (-)-pindolol, betaxolol and ICI118,551 did not affect the actions of fluoxetine, whereas both WAY100,635 and SB224,289 potentiated the increase in levels of 5-HT--but not DA or NAD levels--elicited by fluoxetine. In conclusion, (-)-pindolol modulates, both alone and together with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission in the FCX via a complex pattern of actions at beta 1/2-ARs, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B receptors. These findings have important implications for clinical studies of the influence of (-)-pindolol upon the actions of antidepressant agents.

10439935|t|Entacapone. A review of its use in Parkinson's disease.
10439935|a|UNLABELLED: Entacapone is a potent and specific peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. It has been shown to improve the clinical benefits of levodopa plus an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AADC) when given to patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the 'wearing off' phenomenon). The efficacy of entacapone is currently being assessed in patients with stable Parkinson's disease. In 2 well conducted trials of 6 months' duration and smaller short term studies, treatment with entacapone (200 mg with each dose of levodopa/AADC inhibitor) was associated with significant increases in daily 'on' time and decreases in 'off' time. Changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores concurred with changes in 'on' and 'off' times: entacapone improved total, activities of daily living and motor function scores, but it had no effect on mentation scores. Entacapone also provided benefits when given with controlled release levodopa/ AADC inhibitor or with standard levodopa/AADC inhibitor and selegiline in small trials. Dopaminergic events, including dyskinesia and nausea, are among the most common events with entacapone, and are related to the drug's ability to potentiate the effects of levodopa. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and urine discolouration are the most common nondopaminergic events, although the latter event is the only one to occur consistently more frequently with entacapone than with placebo. However, adverse events of any type infrequently led to study discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone administered with levodopa/AADC inhibitor have not yet been compared with those of other strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, once the decision to initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and the 'wearing off' phenomenon.

10460702|t|5-hydroxytryptamine evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures.
10460702|a|Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) results in the production of nitric oxide (NO) that mediates the vasorelaxing properties of endothelial cells. The goal of this project was to address the possibility that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulates eNOS activity in bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) cultures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT receptors mediate eNOS activation by measuring agonist-stimulated [3H]L-citrulline ([3H]L-Cit) formation in BAEC cultures. We found that 5-HT stimulated the conversion of [3H]L-arginine ([3H]L-Arg) to [3H]L-Cit, indicating eNOS activation. The high affinity 5-HT1B receptor agonist, 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NOT)-stimulated [3H]L-Cit turnover responses were concentration-(0.01 nM to 100 microM) and time-dependent. Maximal responses were observed within 10 min following agonist exposures. These responses were effectively blocked by the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, isamoltane, the 5-HT1B/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methiothepin, and the eNOS selective antagonists (0.01-10 microM): L-Nomega -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and L-N omega-iminoethyl-L-ornithine (L-NIO). Pretreatment of BAEC cultures with pertussis toxin (PTX; 1-100 ng/ml) for 16 hr resulted in significant inhibition of the agonist-stimulated eNOS activity, indicating the involvement of Gi proteins. These findings lend evidence of a 5-HT1B receptor/eNOS pathway, accounting in part for the activation of eNOS by 5-HT. Further investigation is needed to determine the role of other vascular 5-HT receptors in the stimulation of eNOS activity.

10531013|t|Caffeine inhibits the checkpoint kinase ATM.
10531013|a|The basis of many anti-cancer therapies is the use of genotoxic agents that damage DNA and thus kill dividing cells. Agents that cause cells to override the DNA-damage checkpoint are predicted to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic agents. They have therefore been sought as adjuncts in radiation therapy and chemotherapy. One such compound, caffeine, uncouples cell-cycle progression from the replication and repair of DNA [1] [2]. Caffeine therefore servers as a model compound in establishing the principle that agents that override DNA-damage checkpoints can be used to sensitize cells to the killing effects of genotoxic drugs [3]. But despite more than 20 years of use, the molecular mechanisms by which caffeine affects the cell cycle and checkpoint responses have not been identified. We investigated the effects of caffeine on the G2/M DNA-damage checkpoint in human cells. We report that the radiation-induced activation of the kinase Cds1 [4] (also known as Chk2 [5]) is inhibited by caffeine in vivo and that ATM kinase activity is directly inhibited by caffeine in vitro. Inhibition of ATM provides a molecular explanation of the attenuation of DNA-damage checkpoint responses and for the increased radiosensitivity of caffeine-treated cells [6] [7] [8].

10546982|t|Serotonin transporter production and degradation rates: studies with RTI-76.
10546982|a|The objective of this study was to examine the turnover of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by determining its production rate (r), degradation rate constant (k) and half-life of recovery (t1/2). The turnover of SERT was determined from the rate of recovery of binding after administration of RTI-76, an irreversible inhibitor of ligand binding. In preliminary studies, in vitro incubation of rat cerebral cortex with RTI-76 produced a wash and temperature resistant inhibition of SERT binding densities (Bmax). Citalopram protected against the RTI-76-induced inhibition of SERT binding. Following 6 h of in vivo intracerebroventricular injections of 100 nmol of RTI-76, there was a dose- and time-dependent reduction (- 60%) of SERT binding in hippocampus and striatum, without a change in the Kd. SERT binding densities recovered over several days, reaching control levels by day 14. The recovery curve fit the standard model of protein synthesis and degradation. The turnover parameters of SERT were determined in hippocampus and striatum, regions that receive serotonergic innervation from the dorsal and median midbrain raphe nuclei, respectively. In the hippocampus, the production rate constant was 2.36 fmol mg protein (-1)h(-1); the degradation rate constant was 0.0077 h(-1); and the half-life of the SERT recovery was 3.4 days. The values in the striatum were similar. The decrease and recovery of [3H]-5-HT uptake correlated highly (r = 0.93) with the recovery of SERT binding.

10575283|t|Cannabis and cannabinoids: pharmacology and rationale for clinical use.
10575283|a|It is now known that there are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors. These are CB1 receptors, present mainly on central and peripheral neurones, and CB2 receptors, present mainly on immune cells. Endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists ('endocannabinoids') have also been identified. The discovery of this 'endogenous cannabinoid system' has led to the development of selective CB1 and CB2 receptor ligands and fueled renewed interest in the clinical potential of cannabinoids. Two cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists are already used clinically, as antiemetics or as appetite stimulants. These are D 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nabilone. Other possible uses for CB1 receptor agonists include the suppression of muscle spasm/spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, the relief of chronic pain and the management of glaucoma and bronchial asthma. CB1 receptor antagonists may also have clinical applications, e. g. as appetite suppressants and in the management of schizophrenia or disorders of cognition and memory. So too may CB2 receptor ligands and drugs that activate cannabinoid receptors indirectly by augmenting endocannabinoid levels at cannabinoid receptors. When taken orally, THC seems to undergo variable absorption and to have a narrow 'therapeutic window' (dose range in which it is effective without producing significant unwanted effects). This makes it difficult to predict an oral dose that will be both effective and tolerable to a patient and indicates a need for better cannabinoid formulations and modes of administration. For the therapeutic potential of cannabis or CB1 receptor agonists to be fully exploited, it will be important to establish objectively and conclusively (a) whether these agents have efficacy against selected symptoms that is of clinical significance and, if so, whether the benefits outweigh the risks, (b) whether cannabis has therapeutic advantages over individual cannabinoids, (c) whether there is a need for additional drug treatments to manage any of the disorders against which cannabinoids are effective, and (d) whether it will be possible to develop drugs that have reduced psychotropic activity and yet retain the ability to act through CB1 receptors to produce their sought-after effects.

10579749|t|Pharmacological properties of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
10579749|a|The availability of selective, potent, orally active and long acting nonpeptide angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity to obtain the benefits of selectively blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system at the level of the AT1 receptor that mediates most, if not all, of the important actions of angiotensin II, and avoid the nonspecificity of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors. Losartan was the first, but by no means remained the only, AT1 receptor antagonist. Numerous other 'sartans' have emerged in the past several years and successfully completed clinical development. With the exception of eprosartan, all others, ie, candesartan, irbesartan, saprisartan, tasosartan, telmisartan, valsartan and zolasartan, are based on medications of losartan's prototypical chemical structure. Among the current AT1 receptor antagonists, the rank order of the relative binding affinities (highest affinity = 1) is: candesartan 1, telmisartan 10, E3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) 10, tasosartan 20, losartan 50, eprosartan 100 and the prodrug candesartan cilexetil 280. The mode of (functional) AT1 receptor antagonism has been characterized as surmountable/noncompetitive (losartan, tasosartan, eprosartan) or insurmountable/noncompetitive (candesartan, saprisartan, zolasartan, irbesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, E3174). It is very likely that slow dissociation kinetics from the AT1 receptor underlie insurmountable antagonism. However, competitive or noncompetitive antagonism does not determine the antihypertensive efficacy, but the slow off-rate may extend the occupancy of the AT1 receptor and thereby lengthen the duration of the antihypertensive effect.

10637238|t|Comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal therapy as first-line therapy for metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.
10637238|a|PURPOSE: Although hormonal therapy represents standard therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive disease, many patients receive initial chemotherapy because of the location, bulk, or aggressiveness of their disease. It is uncertain whether simultaneous hormonal therapy provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E3186 was initiated to explore this question. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil inverted question markCAF) or chemohormonal therapy (CAF plus tamoxifen and Halotestin inverted question markfluoxymesterone; Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI inverted question markCAFTH) as front-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and TH as a secondary randomization. RESULTS: The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received CAF and CAFTH were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received chemohormonal therapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER-positive compared with ER-negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for CAF v 29.3 months for CAFTH). CONCLUSION: In patients with potentially hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer, chemohormonal therapy prolongs TTF for ER-positive patients without improving overall survival.

10683249|t|Characterization and partial purification of microsomal NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases.
10683249|a|Quinone oxidoreductases are flavoproteins that catalyze two-electron reduction and detoxification of quinones. This leads to the protection of cells against toxicity, mutagenicity, and cancer due to exposure to environmental and synthetic quinones and its precursors. Two cytosolic forms of quinone oxidoreductases [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2)] were previously identified, purified, and cloned. A role of cytosolic NQO1 in protection of cells from oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity of quinones was established. Currently, we have characterized and partially purified the NQO activity from rat liver microsomes. This activity was designated as microsomal NQO (mNQO). The mNQO activity showed significantly higher affinity for NADH than NADPH as electron donors and catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and menadione. The mNQO activity was insensitive to dicoumarol, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic NQO1. Western analysis of microsomal proteins revealed 29- and 18-kDa bands that cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against cytosolic NQO1. The mNQO activity was partially purified by solubilization of microsomes with detergent Chaps, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. The microsomal mNQO proteins are expected to provide additional protection after cytosolic NQOs against quinone toxicity and mutagenicity.

10688973|t|Opioid activity profiles indicate similarities between the nociceptin/orphanin FQ and opioid receptors.
10688973|a|Nociceptin (orphanin FQ) is the recently discovered peptide agonist for the orphan receptor opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1). Despite the high sequence homology between ORL1 and the opioid receptors, most opioids lack affinity for the nociceptin receptor. The affinity and functional profile of opioids possessing activity at the nociceptin receptor was determined using [3H]nociceptin and nociceptin-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding. The mu-opioid receptor-selective agonist lofentanil potently and competitively displaced [3H]nociceptin at rat brain receptors (IC(50) 62 nM). Lofentanil exhibited full agonism for enhancement of [35S]GTPgammaS binding to human recombinant ORL1 receptors (EC(50) 50 nM). The related piperidines ohmefentanyl and sufentanil and the nonselective opioid receptor agonist etorphine were less potent nociceptin receptor agonists. The kappa(1)+kappa(3)-opioid receptor agonist/mu-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone benzoylhydrazone was a pure antagonist at both rat brain and human ORL1 receptors. The nonselective opioid receptor partial agonist buprenorphine and the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist (-)-quadazocine exhibited pure antagonism at rat brain receptors, but displayed partial agonism at human ORL1 receptors. Thus, opioids displaying full agonism at the nociceptin receptor are also opioid receptor agonists, whereas opioids that are antagonists or partial agonists at the nociceptin receptor show antagonism or partial agonism at opioid receptors. In addition, the stereospecificity required at opioid receptors appears to be retained at the nociceptin receptor, since (+)-quadazocine is inactive at both receptors. These findings illustrate the structural and functional homology of the opioid recognition site on these two receptor classes and suggest that opioids may provide leads for the design of nonpeptide nociceptin receptor agonists and antagonists lacking affinity for the classical opioid receptors.

10697523|t|Effects of long-term administration of UFT plus leucovorin on colorectal tumors induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
10697523|a|Thymidylate synthase and thymidine kinase are key enzymes involved in the de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, respectively. Thymidylate synthase is inhibited by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, forming an inactive ternary complex with intracellular folate. We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells. These results indicate that the combination of UFT with leucovorin could be useful in the development of pre- and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy programs.

10698696|t|Antizyme inhibitor is rapidly induced in growth-stimulated mouse fibroblasts and releases ornithine decarboxylase from antizyme suppression.
10698696|a|Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyses the first step in the synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. The polyamines are essential for cell growth, but at elevated levels they may be tumorigenic, toxic, or may induce apoptosis. Therefore, ODC activity is highly regulated. It is induced when cells are stimulated to grow, and it is subjected to feedback inhibition by the polyamines. By causing ribosomal frameshifting, polyamines induce the synthesis of antizyme, a 23-kDa protein, which binds to ODC, inhibits its activity and promotes its degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Antizyme, in turn, is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor (AZI). We describe the cloning of a mouse AZI cDNA, encoding a protein with high homology to mouse ODC. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show that AZI (which has no ODC activity) can release enzymically active ODC from antizyme suppression in vitro. We also show that ODC reactivation takes place in mouse fibroblasts upon transient transfection with an AZI-expressing plasmid construct. Finally we demonstrate that the AZI mRNA content of mouse fibroblasts increases significantly within an hour of growth stimulation, i.e. much earlier than ODC transcripts. Our results indicate that induction of AZI synthesis may represent a means of rescuing ODC molecules that have been inactivated and tagged for degradation by antizyme, when culture conditions improve and polyamine production is needed for cell growth and proliferation.

10742288|t|Characterization of human recombinant alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors expressed in Chinese hamster lung cells using extracellular acidification rate changes.
10742288|a|1. Human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts have been characterized pharmacologically using a cytosensor microphysiometer to measure ligand-induced extracellular acidification rate changes. 2. In untransfected CHL cells, noradrenaline had no effect at concentrations up to 100 microM. In alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor transfected cells the rank order of agonist potency was A-54741 (mean pEC(50)=8.96)>dexmedetomidine (8.88)>UK-14304 (8.42)>B-HT 920 (7.05)>noradrenaline (6.92). A-54741, UK-14304 and noradrenaline had the same maximum response while dexmedetomidine and B-HT 920 behaved as partial agonists. 3. The selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligand rauwolscine antagonized acidification rate changes with an affinity independent of the agonist used; the affinity (mean pK(B)) against noradrenaline was 8.43. 4. The selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligands prazosin and doxazosin (each 3 microM) had no effect on noradrenaline responses. 5. Acidification rate changes induced by each agonist were abolished by pre-treatment of cells with pertussis toxin. 6. These data suggest that agonist-induced acidification rate responses in CHL cells transfected with the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor are mediated exclusively by the recombinant protein, via pertussis toxin sensitive G(i/o) proteins.

10796070|t|Pharmacological characterization of glucocorticoid receptors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells.
10796070|a|Bronchial epithelial cells play an important role in amplifying and perpetuating airway inflammation and may be a target for inhaled steroids. We have characterized glucocorticoid receptors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Northern and western blot analyses demonstrated the expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein, respectively, in primary bronchial epithelial cells. The activity of these receptors was shown using a radioligand binding assay. High-affinity binding with pharmacological specificity was demonstrated for [3H]dexamethasone. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and density of binding sites (Bmax) for [3H]dexamethasone determined from saturation isotherms were 4.4 nM x/divided by 0.95 (SEM) and 30.1 fmol/mg protein +/-6.4 (SEM). Glucocorticoid receptors were activated by dexamethasone as assessed using a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid, pTAT3-CAT. Transfection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells with this reporter plasmid resulted in 35-fold activation of transcription following dexamethasone stimulation (10(-6) M). The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (mifepristone) significantly counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor activation, indicating that the dexamethasone effect is specific and is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. In summary, our study demonstrated that primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells possess glucocorticoid receptors that function as a ligand-activated transcriptional regulator. The presence of glucocorticoid receptors confers their responsiveness to glucocorticoids and indicates that the airway epithelium may be a target for the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled steroids.

10800083|t|Molecular characterization of the surface of apoptotic neutrophils: implications for functional downregulation and recognition by phagocytes.
10800083|a|We have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies and lectins to examine the profile of surface molecule expression on human neutrophils that have undergone spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro culture. Neutrophil apoptosis was found to be accompanied by down-regulation of the immunoglobulin superfamily members PECAM-1 (CD31), ICAM-3 (CD50), CD66acde, and CD66b and the integrin-associated proteins CD63 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (CD87) that may alter the potential for adhesive interactions. Cellular interactions may be further influenced by the reduction of the expression of surface carbohydrate moieties, including sialic acid. Reduced expression of FcgammaRII (CD32), complement receptor type 1 (CD35) and receptors for pro-inflammatory mediators C5a (CD88) and TNFalpha (CD120b) associated with apoptosis might limit neutrophil responsiveness to stimuli that trigger degranulation responses. Although many of the receptors we have examined are expressed at reduced levels on apoptotic neutrophils, we found that there was differential loss of certain receptors (e.g. CD16, CD15 and CD120b) and increased expression of aminopeptidase-N (CD13). Together with our previous data showing that expression of certain molecules e.g. LFA-3 (CD58) is not altered during neutrophil apoptosis, these data are suggestive of specific changes in receptor mobilisation and shedding associated with apoptosis. Although reduced expression of CD63 (azurophilic granules) and CR1 (specific granules) indicates that granule mobilisation does not accompany apoptosis, a monoclonal antibody (BOB78), that recognises a 90 kDa antigen localised in intracellular granules, defines a subpopulation of apoptotic neutrophils that exhibit nuclear degradation yet retain intact plasma membranes. BOB78 positive neutrophils were found to bind biotinylated thrombospondin, suggesting that this mAb defines surface molecular changes associated with exposure of thrombospondin binding moieties.

10839333|t|A positron emission tomography study of quetiapine in schizophrenia: a preliminary finding of an antipsychotic effect with only transiently high dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.
10839333|a|BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic medication. As such, relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose range and relate this information to its clinical profile. METHODS: Twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3 hours after last dose. RESULTS: Quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation. The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this suggestion.

10866053|t|Correlations of receptor binding and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of insulin analogs designed for clinical use.
10866053|a|In recent years, analogs of human insulin have been engineered with the aim of improving therapy for people with diabetes. To ensure that the safety profile of the human hormone is not compromised by the molecular modifications, the toxico-pharmacological properties of insulin analogs should be carefully monitored. In this study, we compared the insulin and IGF-I receptor binding properties and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of insulin aspart (B28Asp human insulin), insulin lispro (B28Lys,B29Pro human insulin), insulin glargine (A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin), insulin detemir (NN304) [B29Lys(epsilon-tetradecanoyl), desB30 human insulin], and reference insulin analogs. Receptor affinities were measured using purified human receptors, insulin receptor dissociation rates were determined using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor, metabolic potencies were evaluated using primary mouse adipocytes, and mitogenic potencies were determined in human osteosarcoma cells. Metabolic potencies correlated well with insulin receptor affinities. Mitogenic potencies in general correlated better with IGF-I receptor affinities than with insulin receptor off-rates. The 2 rapid-acting insulin analogs aspart and lispro resembled human insulin on all parameters, except for a slightly elevated IGF-I receptor affinity of lispro. In contrast, the 2 long-acting insulin analogs, glargine and detemir, differed significantly from human insulin. The combination of the B31B32diArg and A21Gly substitutions provided insulin glargine with a 6- to 8-fold increased IGF-I receptor affinity and mitogenic potency compared with human insulin. The attachment of a fatty acid chain to LysB29 provided insulin detemir with reduced receptor affinities and metabolic and mitogenic potencies but did not change the balance between mitogenic and metabolic potencies. The safety implications of the increased growth-stimulating potential of insulin glargine are unclear. The reduced in vitro potency of insulin detemir might explain why this analog is not as effective on a molar basis as human insulin in humans.

10887187|t|TWIK-2, an inactivating 2P domain K+ channel.
10887187|a|We cloned human and rat TWIK-2 and expressed this novel 2P domain K(+) channel in transiently transfected COS cells. TWIK-2 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, and the immune system. Rat TWIK-2 currents are about 15 times larger than human TWIK-2 currents, but both exhibit outward rectification in a physiological K(+) gradient and mild inward rectification in symmetrical K(+) conditions. TWIK-2 currents are inactivating at depolarized potentials, and the kinetic of inactivation is highly temperature-sensitive. TWIK-2 shows an extremely low conductance, which prevents the visualization of discrete single channel events. The inactivation and rectification are intrinsic properties of TWIK-2 channels. In a physiological K(+) gradient, TWIK-2 is half inhibited by 0.1 mm Ba(2+), quinine, and quinidine. Finally, cysteine 53 in the M1P1 external loop is required for functional expression of TWIK-2 but is not critical for subunit self-assembly. TWIK-2 is the first reported 2P domain K(+) channel that inactivates. The base-line, transient, and delayed activities of TWIK-2 suggest that this novel 2P domain K(+) channel may play an important functional role in cell electrogenesis.

10917903|t|Addition of eicosapentaenoic acid to gamma-linolenic acid-supplemented diets prevents serum arachidonic acid accumulation in humans.
10917903|a|Previous studies reveal that supplementation of human diets with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) reduces the generation of lipid mediators of inflammation and attenuates clinical symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, we have shown that supplementation with this same fatty acid also causes a marked increase in serum arachidonate (AA) levels, a potentially harmful side effect. The objective of this study was to design a supplementation strategy that maintained the capacity of GLA to reduce lipid mediators without causing elevations in serum AA levels. Initial in vitro studies utilizing HEP-G2 liver cells revealed that addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) blocked Delta-5-desaturase activity, the terminal enzymatic step in AA synthesis. To test the in vivo effects of a GLA and EPA combination in humans, adult volunteers consuming controlled diets supplemented these diets with 3.0 g/d of GLA and EPA. This supplementation strategy significantly increased serum levels of EPA, but did not increase AA levels. EPA and the elongation product of GLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) levels in neutrophil glycerolipids increased significantly during the 3-wk supplementation period. Neutrophils isolated from volunteers fed diets supplemented with GLA and EPA released similar quantities of AA, but synthesized significantly lower quantities of leukotrienes compared with their neutrophils before supplementation. This study revealed that a GLA and EPA supplement combination may be utilized to reduce the synthesis of proinflammatory AA metabolites, and importantly, not induce potentially harmful increases in serum AA levels.

10931813|t|Effects of a K(+) channel opener to reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization and prevent torsade de pointes in LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 models of the long-QT syndrome.
10931813|a|BACKGROUND: This study examines the effects of nicorandil, a K(+) channel opener, on transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP) under conditions mimicking the LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 forms of the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials of epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle together with a transmural ECG. Chromanol 293B (30 micromol/L) was used to block I(Ks) (LQT1 model). Isoproterenol (50 to 100 nmol/L) was used to mimic an increase in beta-adrenergic tone, d-sotalol (100 micromol/L) to block I(Kr) (LQT2 model), and ATX-II (20 nmol/L) to augment late I(Na) (LQT3 model). Isoproterenol+chromanol 293B, d-sotalol, and ATX-II produced preferential prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) of the M cell, an increase of TDR, and spontaneous as well as stimulation-induced TdP (LQT1, 3/6; LQT2, 3/6; LQT3, 5/6). Nicorandil (2 to 20 micromol/L) abbreviated the QT interval and APD(90) of the 3 cell types in the 3 models. High concentrations (10 to 20 micromol/L) completely reversed the effects of 293B+/-isoproterenol and those of d-sotalol to increase APD(90) and TDR and to induce TdP in LQT1 and LQT2 models. Nicorandil 20 micromol/L reversed only 50% of the effect of ATX-II and failed to completely suppress TdP in the LQT3 model (5/6 to 3/6). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that K(+) channel openers may be capable of abbreviating the long QT interval, reducing TDR, and preventing spontaneous and stimulation-induced TdP when congenital or acquired LQTS is secondary to reduced I(Kr) or I(Ks) but less so when it is due to augmented late I(Na).

10933891|t|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activators, bezafibrate and Wy-14,643, increase uncoupling protein-3 mRNA levels without modifying the mitochondrial membrane potential in primary culture of rat preadipocytes.
10933891|a|Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are inner mitochondrial membrane transporters which act as pores for H(+) ions, dissipating the electrochemical gradient that develops during mitochondrial respiration at the expense of ATP synthesis. We have studied the effects of two fibrates, bezafibrate and Wy-14,643, on UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA levels in primary monolayer cultures of rat adipocytes and undifferentiated preadipocytes. Treatment with both PPARalpha activators for 24 h up-regulated UCP-3 mRNA levels. Thus, bezafibrate treatment resulted in an 8-fold induction in UCP-3 mRNA levels in preadipocytes compared with the 3.5-fold induction observed in adipocytes. Differences in the induction of UCP-3 between these cells correlated well with the higher expression of PPARalpha and RXRalpha mRNA values in preadipocytes compared to adipocytes. Wy-14,643 caused similar effects on UCP-3 mRNA expression. In contrast to UCP-3, UCP-2 mRNA levels were only slightly modified by bezafibrate in adipocytes. The induction in UCP-3 expression was not accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential of rat primary preadipocytes after bezafibrate or Wy-14,643 treatment. Since it has been proposed that UCP-3 could be involved in the regulation of the use of fatty acids as fuel substrates, the UCP-3 induction achieved after bezafibrate and Wy-14, 643 treatment may indicate a higher oxidation of fatty acids, limiting their availability to be stored as triglycerides. This change may result in a reduced rate of conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes, which directly affects fat depots.

10939639|t|Schisandrin B protects against menadione-induced hepatotoxicity by enhancing DT-diaphorase activity.
10939639|a|Pretreating mice with schisandrin B (Sch B), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, at a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days protected against menadione-induced hepatic oxidative damage in mice, as evidenced by decreases in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity (78%) and hepatic malondialdehyde level (70%), when compared with the menadione intoxicated control. In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.

10942908|t|Interactive and delayed effects of pyridostigmine and physical stress on biochemical and histological changes in peripheral tissues of mice.
10942908|a|Gulf War veterans were taking pyridostigmine orally against possible exposure to nerve agents as well as being under physical stress. This study was designed to investigate the delayed effects of pyridostigmine and treadmill exercise on cholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation and histology of peripheral tissues of mice. Male NIH Swiss mice were divided into four groups of 15 animals each and treated as follows: sedentary control; exercise training for 10 weeks; pyridostigmine (1.2 mg kg(-1), p.o.) for 2 weeks during weeks 5 and 6; and pyridostigmine plus exercise training. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last exercise, and blood, triceps muscle and sciatic nerve were isolated and analyzed. The group treated with pyridostigmine alone showed decreased plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity (87% of control), whereas pyridostigmine plus exercise significantly decreased the BChE activity (79% of control), indicating an interactive effect of the combination. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity did not alter significantly in red blood cells, platelets or sciatic nerve with either of the treatments. However, AChE activity in triceps muscle decreased significantly (78% of control) in the group treated with pyridostigmine plus exercise. Creatine phosphokinase activity in plasma increased slightly (compared to control, pyridostigmine or exercise group) in mice treated with pyridostigmine plus exercise, which may be indicative of perturbation in the integrity of the skeletal muscle due to combination. However, there were no obvious histological abnormalities in the triceps muscle detected between experimental and control groups. Interaction of pyridostigmine and exercise significantly increased the concentration of the end product of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) (124% of control) in triceps muscle, indicating an oxidative stress response of the combination. These results indicate that physical stress enhanced the delayed toxic effects of a subchronic oral dose of pyridostigmine primarily in the skeletal muscle of mice.

11056242|t|Effect of hormonal agents on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression by endometrial epithelial cells of women with endometriosis.
11056242|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hormonal agents used in the medical treatment of endometriosis, such as danazol and GnRH agonist, exert direct regulatory action on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by endometrial epithelial cells. DESIGN: Primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from human endometrium were exposed to different concentrations of cytokines and steroid hormone analogs. Expression of MCP-1 was analyzed at the levels of protein and messenger RNA. SETTING: Gynecology clinic and laboratory of endocrinology of reproduction. PATIENT(S): Women presenting for infertility or pelvic pain in whom endometriosis was diagnosed by using laparoscopy. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial tissue biopsy performed at laparoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Secretion of MCP-1 protein was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA steady-state levels were measured by performing Northern blot analysis. RESULT(S): Buserelin acetate, a GnRH agonist (0.1-10 ng/mL), had no significant effect on MCP-1 expression, whereas danazol (10(-7)-10(-5) M), a testosterone analog, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid hormone (10(-12)-10(-6)M), showed a direct and a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MCP-1 expression. This effect occurred at the level of protein and mRNA. CONCLUSION(S): The findings of the study may affect understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal treatments act on endometriosis and influence its clinical manifestations.

11146120|t|Pharmacological modulation of nerve growth factor synthesis: a mechanistic comparison of vitamin D receptor and beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists.
11146120|a|Increasing nerve growth factor (NGF) in the PNS is a rational strategy for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders. The present studies were undertaken to compare two compounds, a vitamin D(3) analogue (CB1093) with minimal calcaemic effects, and clenbuterol, a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, both of which induce NGF synthesis in vivo. Clenbuterol caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein in 3T3 cells; with maxima at 10 nM and at 8-12 h exposure. Effects of clenbuterol on NGF mRNA were antagonized by propranolol. Mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that clenbuterol increased AP1 binding in 3T3 cells prior to increasing NGF synthesis. Clenbuterol was without effect on NGF mRNA levels in L929 cells, whereas CB1093 caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein levels in both 3T3 and L929 cells. Stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at least 72 h. The magnitude of the increase was much greater in L929 (700% increase) than in 3T3 cells (80%). Binding to the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor itself, was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of CB1093 and maintained up to 24 h. Increased VDR binding preceded increased NGF mRNA. A 150% increase in AP-1 binding was also evident. This study demonstrates that CB1093 and clenbuterol stimulate NGF levels in vitro and that AP-1 binding could be a commonality between the mechanism of NGF induction of these two compounds.

11157886|t|Protective effect of halothane anesthesia on retinal light damage: inhibition of metabolic rhodopsin regeneration.
11157886|a|PURPOSE: To determine whether the volatile anesthetic halothane protects against light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in the rodent retina. METHODS: Albino mice and rats were anesthetized with halothane and exposed to high levels of white or blue light. Nonanesthetized animals served as controls. Retinal morphology was assessed by light microscopy, and apoptosis of photoreceptor cells was verified by detection of fragmented genomic DNA and in situ staining of apoptotic nuclei (TUNEL assay). Rhodopsin regeneration after bleaching was determined by measuring rhodopsin levels in retinas of mice or rats at different time points in darkness. RESULTS: Halothane anesthesia reversibly inhibited metabolic rhodopsin regeneration and thus prevented rhodopsin from absorbing high numbers of photons during light exposure. Consequently, photoreceptors of mice and rats anesthetized with halothane were completely protected against degeneration induced by white light. In remarkable contrast, however, halothane anesthesia did not protect against blue-light-induced photoreceptor cell death. CONCLUSIONS: After the initial bleach, halothane impeded photon absorption by rhodopsin by inhibiting metabolic rhodopsin regeneration. Apparently, the rhodopsin-mediated uptake of the critical number of photons to initiate white light-induced retinal degeneration was prevented. In contrast, halothane did not protect the retina against blue light. Blue light can efficiently restore functional rhodopsin from bleaching intermediates through a process termed photoreversal of bleaching. This process does not depend on the visual cycle via the pigment epithelium but nevertheless enables rhodopsin molecules to absorb the critical number of photons required to induce retinal degeneration.

11243491|t|Comparison of antidepressant activity in 4- and 40-week-old male mice in the forced swimming test: involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in old mice.
11243491|a|RATIONALE: A recent study suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were inactive in 40-week-old male mice in the mouse forced swimming test, possibly because of alteration of 5-HT1 receptors. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed at investigating the action of various antidepressant drugs in 4- and 40-week-old male mice using the mouse forced swimming test and determining the involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors mediating the effects. METHODS: Different classes of antidepressants [imipramine (tricyclic), maprotiline (noradrenline reuptake inhibitor), venlafaxine (mixed serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), fluvoxamine and sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)] were tested in the same randomised experimental session, alone and in combination with 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists [buspirone (partial 5-HT1A agonist), anpirtoline (5-HT1B agonist)] in the mouse forced swimming test. RESULTS: All antidepressants were found to be active in the mouse forced swimming test in 4-week-old mice and 40-week-old mice, with the exception of fluvoxamine in the 40-week-old mice. The anti-immobility effect after antidepressant administration was higher in 4-week-old male mice than in 40-week-old male mice. Venlafaxine is the most active antidepressant drug in 40-week-old mice. Prior administration of buspirone (0.06 mg/kg, i.p.) or anpirtoline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the antidepressant-like effects in 4-week-old mice (except in the case of sertraline, 8 mg/kg). In elderly mice, only prior administration of buspirone enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of fluvoxamine. A neurochemical study showed that significantly higher serotonin and dopamine concentrations were found in 40-week-old control mice brains than 4-week-old control mice brains but that the noradrenaline concentration is higher in 4-week-old mice. CONCLUSION: Tricyclic, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are more active in 4-week-old mice than 40-week-old mice. Our results suggested that 5-HT1B receptors may be more altered than 5-HT1A receptors in 40-week-old mice.

11246504|t|Cytochrome P450 4A, peroxisomal enzymes and nicotinamide cofactors in koala liver.
11246504|a|We have examined hepatic levels of microsomal lauric acid hydroxylase activity and cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl coenzyme A oxidative activity in koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and compared our results to those determined in rat. Microsomal lauric acid hydroxylation was significantly higher in koala than in tammar wallaby or rat. However, cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was absent in the koala. We have also determined the hepatic nicotinamide cofactors in these species. Hepatic nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and the ratio of NAD/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) were higher in koala than in tammar wallaby and rat liver. Reverse transcription of koala liver mRNA, followed by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on highly conserved areas in the CYP4A family led to the cloning of a partial, near full length, cDNA clone with approximately 70% nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identity to human CYP4A11. The CYP has been named CYP4A15.

11304699|t|Distal bowel selectivity in the chemoprevention of experimental colon carcinogenesis by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone.
11304699|a|Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chemoprevention of colon cancer has been hindered by their potential gastro-intestinal toxicity. Nabumetone, which is approximately 10 to 36 times safer than conventional NSAIDs, was evaluated in 2 models of experimental colon carcinogenesis. In azoxymethane (AOM)-treated Fisher 344 rats, nabumetone caused dose-dependent inhibition of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), with 750 and 1,500 ppm resulting in 15% and 37% reductions, respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, complex ACF were reduced by 48% in the latter group. MIN mice studies confirmed the chemopreventive efficacy of nabumetone, with 900 ppm suppressing approximately half of the intestinal tumors. Interestingly, inhibition of intermediate biomarkers in both models was markedly greater in the distal than the proximal bowel. To mechanistically evaluate this regional selectivity, we assessed cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the uninvolved mucosa and demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold excess in the distal relative to the proximal bowel in both MIN mice and AOM-treated rats. We then investigated another putative NSAID target, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) and demonstrated up-regulation during AOM-induced colonic tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in pre-neoplastic mucosa, there was a 3-fold excess of PPAR-delta in the distal colon. We demonstrate that nabumetone is an effective protective agent in both experimental models of colon carcinogenesis. The striking distal predilection of nabumetone may be, at least partially, explained by distal bowel over-expression of COX-2 and PPAR-delta.

11309392|t|Nuclear diacylglycerol kinase-theta is activated in response to alpha-thrombin.
11309392|a|Currently, there is substantial evidence that nuclear lipid metabolism plays a critical role in a number of signal transduction cascades. Previous work from our laboratory showed that stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with alpha-thrombin leads to the production of two lipid second messengers in the nucleus: an increase in nuclear diacylglycerol mass and an activation of phospholipase D, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, making it an attractive candidate for a signal transduction component. There is substantial evidence that this activity is indeed regulated in a number of signaling cascades (reviewed by van Blitterswijk, W. J., and Houssa, B. (1999) Chem. Phys. Lipids 98, 95-108). In this report, we show that the addition of alpha-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts results in an increase in nuclear DGK activity. The examination of nuclei isolated from quiescent IIC9 cells indicates that DGK-theta and DGK-delta are both present. We took advantage of the previous observations that phosphatidylserine inhibits DGK-delta (reviewed by Sakane, F., Imai, S., Kai, M., Wada, I., and Kanoh, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8394-8401), and constitutively active RhoA inhibits DGK-theta (reviewed by Houssa, B., de Widt, J., Kranenburg, O., Moolenaar, W. H., and van Blitterswijk, W. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6820-6822) to identify the activity induced by alpha-thrombin. Constitutively active RhoA inhibited the nuclear stimulated activity, whereas phosphatidylserine did not have an inhibitory effect. In addition, a monoclonal anti-DGK-theta antibody inhibited the alpha-thrombin-stimulated nuclear activity in vitro. These results demonstrate that DGK-theta is the isoform responsive to alpha-thrombin stimulation. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses showed that alpha-thrombin induced the translocation of DGK-theta to the nucleus, implicating that this translocation is at least partly responsible for the increased nuclear activity. Taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate an agonist-induced activity of nuclear DGK-theta activity and a nuclear localization of DGK-delta.

11318430|t|Pharmacokinetic analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of intravenous nordihydroguaiaretic acid in the mouse.
11318430|a|Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) has been shown to inhibit both 5-lipoxygenase and ornithine decarboxylase and is active against several cancer cell lines and at least one mouse tumor model. Despite these findings, there have been no reports on the pharmacokinetics of NDGA. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to detect NDGA in mouse plasma. The limit of detection of this method was 0.5 microg/ml. Administration of NDGA (50 mg/kg, i.v.) to mice resulted in a peak plasma concentration of 14.7 microg/ml. The terminal half-life of NDGA was 135.0 min with a clearance of 201.9 ml/min x kg.

11392054|t|Vasoconstrictive drugs increase carbonic anhydrase I in vascular smooth muscle while vasodilating drugs reduce the activity of this isozyme by a direct mechanism of action.
11392054|a|Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a zinc enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration reaction of CO2 and plays a major role in the acid-base balance. We have previously shown that certain vasoconstrictive therapeutic agents increase CA I activity whereas vasodilating drugs reduce the activity of this isozyme by a direct mechanism of action. In this paper we studied the effect of other vasoconstrictive and vasodilating agents on CA I activity in order to elucidate the involvement of vascular smooth muscle CA I in vasoconstrictive and vasodilating processes. We studied the in vitro effects of noradrenaline, prostaglandin F2 alpha, thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, angiotensin II, vasopressin, indomethacin, prazosin, hydralazine, clonidine, reserpine, prostaglandin I2, indapamide, furosemide, amlodipine, verapamil and irbesartan on purified human red blood cell CA I and vascular smooth muscle CA I isolated from rabbits. In vivo, we selected six groups of five rabbits each, which were administered the following substances in acute experiments: orciprenaline (group 1), desmopressin (group 2), verapamil (group 3), irbesartan (group 4), acetazolamide (group 5) and placebo (control group). Vascular smooth muscle CA I activity and systolic blood pressure were determined and compared with those of the control group. In vitro results showed that all the vasoconstrictive agents studied increased purified and human erythrocyte CA I activity as well as vascular smooth muscle CA I, while vasodilating substances reduced the activity of isozyme by a direct mechanism of action. The same results obtained in vivo showed that activation of vascular smooth muscle CA I increased blood pressure while its inhibition reduced blood pressure. The results of this study suggest that pHi changes, induced by activating or inhibiting CA I in vascular smooth muscle, might be responsible for changes in vascular tonus.

11393267|t|Neuroparalysis and oxime efficacy in organophosphate poisoning: a study of butyrylcholinesterase.
11393267|a|The temporal profile of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and in vitro pralidoxime-reactivated BuChE was studied in a cohort of 25 organophosphate-poisoned patients to examine their relationship to the development of intermediate syndrome and to understand reasons for lack of efficacy of oxime treatment. The clinical severity of poisoning (assessed by the Namba Scale) correlated significantly with the severity of intermediate syndrome. BuChE activity increased significantly over time and showed significant relationship to muscle power. The temporal profile of the enzyme was correlated to the clinical severity of poisoning. Reactivation potentials of BuChE (the difference between oxime-reactivated and -unreactivated enzyme activity) declined significantly with time after organophosphate ingestion. The reactivation potential of the enzyme at admission decreased significantly with increasing severity of poisoning and was lower in patients who developed intermediate syndrome. Patients who received oxime prior to hospitalization had a higher rate of intermediate syndrome and lower levels of BuChE at admission than those who had not. The study suggests that (i) BuChE reflects the clinical course of poisoning, confirming earlier studies; (ii) intermediate syndrome may be associated with a persistent inhibition of BuChE; and (iii) the lack of oxime efficacy in our patients maybe due to their severity of poisoning and the timing of oxime treatment.

11481271|t|Potent alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction by brimonidine in porcine ciliary arteries.
11481271|a|PURPOSE: An investigation into whether alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists induce contractions in the porcine ciliary arteries and to characterize the functional receptor subtype mediating these responses. METHODS: Isolated arteries from the intraocular part of the porcine ciliary artery were suspended in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recording. The segments were contracted with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists brimonidine, apraclonidine, and oxymetazoline. To determine which subtypes of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor mediate this contraction, antagonists subselective for the different alpha(2)-adrenoceptors were added to the vessel bath before concentration-response curves for brimonidine were obtained. The following alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists were applied: BRL44408 (alpha(2A)-selective), ARC239 (alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-selective), and prazosin (alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-selective). RESULTS: The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists induced vasoconstriction in the porcine ciliary artery with the following potency order (EC(50)) expressed in nanomolar: brimonidine 2.11, oxymetazoline 5.26, and apraclonidine 13.0. As a reference, noradrenaline was tested, and its EC(50) was determined to be 247 nM in the ciliary artery. In the porcine ciliary arteries BRL44408, ARC239, and prazosin caused concentration-dependent and parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves for brimonidine. Schild analyses for the antagonists against brimonidine yielded regression lines with slopes of unity and functional antagonist potencies (pK(B)) for BRL44408 (7.8), ARC 239 (5.8) and for prazosin (6.0) suggesting the presence of functional alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. Moreover, there was a good correlation of pK(B) with ligand-binding affinity (pK(i)) of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor in the porcine eye tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists brimonidine, apraclonidine, and oxymetazoline are potent vasoconstrictors in the porcine ciliary artery. In the present work, it was shown for the first time that the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor subtype mediates this contraction.

11742712|t|Gemcitabine and pemetrexed disodium combinations in vitro and in vivo.
11742712|a|Pemetrexed disodium (ALIMTA) is a novel antimetabolite that inhibits at least three folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Pemetrexed disodium is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung, breast, bladder, head and neck and ovarian cancers. Gemcitabine is a broadly active pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite, which is approved for the treatment of pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. Three preclinical studies have been reported that show cytotoxic synergy between gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Clinical activity with this combination has been observed in a phase I study, with partial responses in three of five patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer. An international phase II study of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing.

11752472|t|Tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis in plants: molecular and functional characterization of dihydrofolate synthetase and three isoforms of folylpolyglutamate synthetase in Arabidopsis thaliana.
11752472|a|Tetrahydrofolate coenzymes involved in one-carbon (C1) metabolism are polyglutamylated. In organisms that synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) catalyze the attachment of glutamate residues to the folate molecule. In this study we isolated cDNAs coding a DHFS and three isoforms of FPGS from Arabidopsis thaliana. The function of each enzyme was demonstrated by complementation of yeast mutants deficient in DHFS or FPGS activity, and by measuring in vitro glutamate incorporation into dihydrofolate or tetrahydrofolate. DHFS is present exclusively in the mitochondria, making this compartment the sole site of synthesis of dihydrofolate in the plant cell. In contrast, FPGS is present as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol, and the chloroplast. Each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation that is unique among eukaryotes. The compartmentation of FPGS isoforms is in agreement with the predominance of gamma-glutamyl-conjugated tetrahydrofolate derivatives and the presence of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate interconverting enzymes in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids. Thus, the combination of FPGS with these folate-mediated reactions can supply each compartment with the polyglutamylated folate coenzymes required for the reactions of C1 metabolism. Also, the multicompartmentation of FPGS in the plant cell suggests that the transported forms of folate are unconjugated.

11772142|t|Rabeprazole: an update of its use in acid-related disorders.
11772142|a|UNLABELLED: Rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. It causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion. In 8-week studies, among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), rabeprazole 20 mg/day or 10mg twice daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of GORD. Symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole. In long-term trials rabeprazole 10 mg/day was similar to omeprazole 20 mg/day in a 2-year study and superior to placebo in 1-year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed GORD. In nonerosive GORD, 4-week studies have shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and various other gastrointestinal symptoms. Data among patients with Barrett's oesophagus suggest rabeprazole 20 mg/day may be more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after 1 year of treatment. One-week triple Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =85%. Rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori. Eradication rates of >90% were achieved when rabeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was included as part of a quadruple eradication regimen. As monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and symptom relief, 4- to 8-week studies have shown rabeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day to be superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole. Preliminary 1-year data among 16 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggest rabeprazole 60 to 120 mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition. In clinical trials of up to 2 years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole. Common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain. Histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and typical of proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole is a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor. It has proven efficacy in healing, symptom relief and prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers and GORD and can form part of effective H. pylori eradication regimens. It is an important alternative to H(2) antagonists and an additional treatment option to other proton pump inhibitors in the management of acid-related disorders.

11799102|t|Angiotensin II suppression in humans by the orally active renin inhibitor Aliskiren (SPP100): comparison with enalapril.
11799102|a|Renin is the main determinant of angiotensin (Ang) II levels. It, therefore, always appeared desirable to reduce Ang II levels by direct inhibition of renin. So far, specific renin inhibitors lacked potency and/or oral availability. We tested the new orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor SPP100 (Aliskiren, an octanamide with a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] in the low nanomolar range) in 18 healthy volunteers on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium diet using a double-blind, 3-way crossover protocol. In 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days, each volunteer received 2 dosage levels of Aliskiren (low before high; 40 and 80 or 160 and 640 mg/d) and randomized placebo or 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren was well tolerated. Not surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in these normotensive subjects. There was a dose-dependent decrease in plasma renin activity, Ang I, and Ang II following single doses of Aliskiren starting with 40 mg. Inhibition was still marked and significant after repeated dosing with maximal decreases in Ang II levels by 89% and 75% on Days 1 and 8, respectively, when the highest dose of Aliskiren was compared with placebo. At the same time, mean plasma active renin was increased 16- and 34-fold at the highest dose of Aliskiren. Plasma drug levels of Aliskiren were dose-dependent with maximal concentrations reached between 3 to 6 hours after administration; steady state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing. Less than 1% of dose was excreted in the urine. Plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were decreased after doses of Aliskiren > or =80 mg and after enalapril. Aliskiren at 160 and 640 mg enhanced natriuresis on Day 1 by +45% and +62%, respectively, compared with placebo (100%, ie, 87+/-11 mmol/24h) and enalapril (+54%); kaliuresis remained unchanged. In conclusion, the renin inhibitor Aliskiren dose-dependently decreases Ang II levels in humans following oral administration. The effect is long-lasting and, at a dose of 160 mg, is equivalent to that of 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren has the potential to become the first orally active renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ACE-inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.

11808879|t|Heterogeneity of persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. A series of 175 cases.
11808879|a|UNLABELLED: Hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by severe hypoglycaemia due to an inappropriate oversecretion of insulin. In a personal series of 175 patients investigated for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia over the last 20 years, we review clinical presentations, molecular studies and therapeutic management of hyperinsulinism. There were 98 neonatal-onset patients, including 86 permanent hyperinsulinism and 12 transient forms, 68 with infancy-onset and nine with childhood-onset. Hyperammonaemia was found in 12 out of 69 patients tested, 4 neonates and 8 infants. Neonates were clinically more severely affected than infants. Diagnosis of infancy-onset hyperinsulinism was often delayed because of less profound hypoglycaemia and better tolerance to hypoglycaemia. Neonates required higher rates of i.v. glucose than infants to maintain normal plasma glucose levels (16 mg/kg per min versus 12 mg/kg per min). Only 16% of neonates were diazoxide-sensitive compared to 66% of the infants. Neonates with hyperammonaemia or transient hyperinsulinism were diazoxide-sensitive. Most neonates were pancreatectomised whereas 65% of the infants were treated medically. Among surgically-treated patients, 47% had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia (31 neonates and 13 infants) and 53% a diffuse form of hyperinsulinism (39 neonates and 11 infants). Diazoxide-responsiveness in the focal and diffuse forms did not differ in both neonates and infants; it depended only upon the age of onset of hypoglycaemia. One or two mutations, SUR1 or KIR6.2, were found in 41 of 73 neonates who were investigated and in 13/38 infants using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of both genes. Almost all patients with SUR1 (38/41) or KIR6.2 (5/7) mutations were resistant to diazoxide. Ten patients with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome had a mutation in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (three neonates and seven infants) after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of cDNA. No mutation was found by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism in the glucokinase gene. Eight of nine patients with childhood onset hyperinsulinism were treated surgically and histological examination confirmed an adenoma in each case. CONCLUSION: the clinical severity of hyperinsulinism varies mainly with age at onset of hypoglycaemia. The heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism has major consequences in terms of therapeutic outcome and genetic counselling.

11893059|t|Donepezil hydrochloride: a treatment drug for Alzheimer's disease.
11893059|a|The role of the cholinergic system with respect to cognitive deficits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a number of studies focusing on the development of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors as a drug for treating this disease. The earliest known AChE inhibitors, namely, physostigmine and tacrine, performed poorly in clinical trials (e.g., poor oral activity, brain penetration, and hepatotoxic liability). Studies were then focused on finding a new type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that would overcome the disadvantages of these two compounds. Donepezil hydrochloride inaugurates a new class of AChE inhibitors with longer and more selective action and with manageable adverse effects.

11970990|t|Alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant LFA-3/IgG1 fusion protein, induces CD16 signaling and CD2/CD16-dependent apoptosis of CD2(+) cells.
11970990|a|Alefacept, an immunomodulatory recombinant fusion protein composed of the first extracellular domain of LFA-3 fused to the human IgG1 hinge, C(H)2, and C(H)3 domains, has recently been shown in phase II and III clinical trials to safely reduce disease expression in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Alefacept modulates the function of and selectively induces apoptosis of CD2(+) human memory-effector T cells in vivo. We have sought to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of action that influence the biological activity of alefacept and may contribute to its efficacy and patient responsiveness. Specifically evaluated is the ability of alefacept to activate intracellular signals mediated via CD2 and/or Fc gamma RIII (CD16). Experimentation using isoforms of alefacept engineered to have amino acid substitutions in the IgG1 C(H)2 domain that impact Fc gamma R binding indicate that alefacept mediates cognate interactions between cells expressing human CD2 and CD16 to activate cells, e.g., increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, up-regulate cell surface expression of the activation marker CD25, and induce release of granzyme B. In the systems used, this signaling is shown to require binding to CD2 and CD16 and be mediated through CD16, but not CD2. Experimentation using human CD2-transgenic mice and isoforms of alefacept confirmed the requirement for Fc gamma R binding for detection of the pharmacological effects of alefacept in vivo. Thus alefacept acts as an effector molecule, mediating cognate interactions to activate Fc gamma R(+) cells (e.g., NK cells) to induce apoptosis of sensitive CD2(+) target cells.

12046682|t|Thalidomide in multiple myeloma.
12046682|a|Thalidomide--removed from widespread clinical use by 1962 because of severe teratogenicity--has anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, including the inhibition of TNF alpha. It has returned to practice as an effective oral agent in the management of various disease states including erythema nodosum leprosum, for which it was FDA-approved in 1998, and more recently certain malignancies, including multiple myeloma. Whilst the mechanism of action of thalidomide remains incompletely understood, considerable insight has been generated by extensive preclinical studies in multiple myeloma. Moreover, clinical trials both as a single agent and in combination have confirmed benefit in relapsed and refractory disease. Thalidomide's role in treating newly diagnosed patients is currently under study and it is now established as an important therapeutic option in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

12063741|t|[Leflunomide--a new drug for pharmacological immunomodulation].
12063741|a|The novel immunomodulatory agent leflunomide exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory action. This isoxazole derivative is chemically unrelated to any hitherto applied immunosuppressants. As a prodrug leflunomide is completely converted to its active metabolite A 77 1726 (M1) which blocks the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the pyrimidine de novo synthesis. Drug-related adverse effects are mild, dose-related and reversible, characterising leflunomide as a safe immunosuppressant. While up to now leflunomide has just been approved for therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, its mechanism of action affects multiple inflammatory pathways, thereby suggesting it to be a potent therapeutic agent in autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, and tumour therapy. First dermatological experience has been gained in psoriasis and bullous pemphigoid. The role of leflunomide in the dermatologist's therapeutic armamentarium will evolve during the next years.

12080538|t|Existing and emerging endocrine therapies for breast cancer.
12080538|a|Endocrine therapy is first-line therapy for patients with estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Commonly used endocrine therapies are tamoxifen, megestrol acetate, and aromatase inhibitors. Although tamoxifen and megestrol acetate have a favorable therapeutic profile, there are risks associated with these agents. With tamoxifen, the partial agonist property can lead to thromboembolic events. An important adverse event of megestrol acetate is weight gain and fluid retention in some patients. The aromatase inhibitors are currently used as second-line therapy after tamoxifen failure. A recent study showed that anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is as effective or even superior to tamoxifen when used as a first-line therapy. However, not all patients will respond to currently available therapies. A new class of drug, the estrogen receptor downregulators, has been developed. Fulvestrant, the first agent in this new class, not only induces the degradation of the estrogen receptor but also is an estrogen antagonist; further, its lack of agonist activity provides a better safety profile. Two phase III trials have proven that fulvestrant is at least as effective as anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Fulvestrant is an effective and safe endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women who have failed prior endocrine therapy.

12082550|t|Microarray and biochemical analysis of lovastatin-induced apoptosis of squamous cell carcinomas.
12082550|a|We recently identified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, as a potential therapeutic target of the head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and cervical carcinomas (CC). The products of this complex biochemical pathway, including de novo cholesterol, are vital for a variety of key cellular functions affecting membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induces a pronounced apoptotic response in a specific subset of tumor types, including HNSCC and CC. The mediators of this response are not well established. Identification of differentially expressed genes represents a feasible approach to delineate these mediators as lovastatin has the potential to modulate transcription indirectly by perturbing levels of sterols and other mevalonate metabolites. Expression analysis following treatment of the HNSCC cell lines SCC9 or SCC25 with 10 microM lovastatin for 1 day showed that less than 2% (9 cDNAs) of the 588 cDNAs on this microarray were affected in both cell lines. These included diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein, the activated transcription factor 4 and rhoA. Because the biosynthesis of mevalonate leads to its incorporation into more than a dozen classes of end products, their role in lovastatin-induced apoptosis was also evaluated. Addition of the metabolites of all the major branches of the mevalonate pathway indicated that only the nonsterol moiety, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), significantly inhibited the apoptotic effects of lovastatin in HNSCC and CC cells. Because rhoA requires GGPP for its function, this links the microarray and biochemical data and identifies rhoA as a potential mediator of the anticancer properties of lovastatin. Our data suggest that the depletion of nonsterol mevalonate metabolites, particularly GGPP, can be potential mediators of lovastatin-induced apoptosis of HNSCC and CC cells.

12137927|t|Regulation of norepinephrine transporter abundance by catecholamines and desipramine in vivo.
12137927|a|The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates adrenoreceptor signaling by controlling the availability of synaptic norepinephrine (NE), and it is a direct target for some classes of antidepressant drugs. NET levels are normal in dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice that lack NE, demonstrating that the NET does not require endogenous NE for appropriate regulation under physiological conditions. In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase knockout (Th -/-) mice that lack both NE and dopamine (DA) have reduced levels of NET, suggesting that it is down-regulated by a complete absence of catecholamines and not NE per se. Chronic treatment with the NET inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), reduced NET levels in both control and Dbh -/- mice, demonstrating that NE is not required for the regulation of NET by antidepressant drugs. There are some qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of the NET by catecholamine depletion and DMI treatment, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved.

12170059|t|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation of spinal norepinephrine release.
12170059|a|BACKGROUND: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists produce antinociception in animals. nAChRs exist almost exclusively on presynaptic terminals in the central nervous system and stimulate neurotransmitter release. This study tested whether nAChR agonists stimulate spinal release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine either by direct actions on noradrenergic terminals or indirectly by stimulating release of other neurotransmitters to induce norepinephrine release. METHODS: Adult male rats were anesthetized and microdialysis probes inserted in the L2-L4 dermatomes of the spinal cord. Probes were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing nicotine, the specific alpha(4)beta(2*) nAChR agonist metanicotine, or nicotine plus nAChR antagonists and norepinephrine measured in the microdialysates. The effects of specific glutamate receptor antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors were also examined. To determine direct effects on noradrenergic terminals, synaptosomes were prepared from spinal cord and incubated with nAChR agonists and antagonists. RESULTS: Both nicotine and metanicotine induced norepinephrine release in spinal microdialsyates, an effect reduced by nicotinic antagonists but not glutamate antagonists or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Both of the nicotinic agonists stimulated norepinephrine release in synaptosomes, and the effect of metanicotine was blocked at lower concentrations of alpha(4)beta(2*)- than alpha(7*)-preferring nAChR antagonists. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that one mechanism by which nAChR agonists act for analgesia is to stimulate spinal norepinephrine release. They do so by actions on alpha(4)beta(2*) nAChRs, and perhaps other subtypes, most likely located on noradrenergic terminals, rather than by indirectly stimulating norepinephrine release through glutamate release or nitric oxide synthesis.

12180353|t|The pharmacology of cilostazol.
12180353|a|Cilostazol (6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone; OPC-13013) is a 2-oxo-quinoline derivative with antithrombotic, vasodilator, antimitogenic and cardiotonic properties. The compound is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3A, the isoform of PDE 3 in the cardiovascular system (IC50: 0.2 microM). In addition, there is inhibition of adenosine uptake, eventually resulting in changes in cAMP levels, dependent on the type of adenosine receptors (A1 or A2). Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation and has considerable antithrombotic effects in vivo. The compound relaxes vascular smooth muscle and inhibits mitogenesis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. In the heart, cilostazol causes positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Most, if not all, of these actions are cAMP-mediated, including the modification of cAMP-controlled gene expression. Cilostazol decreases levels of serum triglycerides and causes some increase in HDL-cholesterol levels. The compound has a number of additional effects which might contribute to its overall clinical efficacy. Cilostazol undergoes intensive and finally complete hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 systems. This might result in some drug interaction, i.e. with erythromycin and omeprazole. The half-life is approximately 10 h, resulting in about 2-fold accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.

12181427|t|Identification of interaction sites of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 3A with milrinone and cilostazol using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis.
12181427|a|To identify amino acid residues involved in PDE3-selective inhibitor binding, we selected eight presumed interacting residues in the substrate-binding pocket of PDE3A using a model created on basis of homology to the PDE4B crystal structure. We changed the residues to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis technique, expressed the mutants in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, and analyzed the kinetic characteristics of inhibition of the mutant enzymes by milrinone and cilostazol, specific inhibitors of PDE3. The mutants displayed differential sensitivity to the inhibitors. Mutants Y751A, D950A, and F1004A had reduced sensitivity to milrinone (K(i) changed from 0.66 microM for the recombinant PDE3A to 7.5 to 156 microM for the mutants), and diminished sensitivity to cilostazol (K(i) of the mutants were 18- to 371-fold higher than that of the recombinant PDE3A). In contrast, the mutants T844A, F972A and Q975A showed increased K(i) for cilostazol but no difference for milrinone from the recombinant PDE3A. Molecular models show that the PDE3 inhibitors cilostazol and milrinone share some of common residues but interact with distinct residues at the active site, suggesting that selective inhibitors can be designed with flexible size against PDE3 active site. Our study implies that highly conserved residuals Y751, D950 and F1004 in the PDE families are key residues for binding of both substrate and inhibitors, and nonconserved T844 may be responsible for the cilostazol selectivity of PDE3A. Detailed knowledge of the structure of inhibitory sites should contribute to development of more potent and specific inhibitory drugs.

12217700|t|Enzymatic catalysis in crystals of Escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase.
12217700|a|The bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP) catalyses the phosphorolysis of an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond in maltodextrins, removing the non-reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P). In contrast to the well-studied muscle glycogen phosphorylase (GP), MalP exhibits no allosteric properties and has a higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than GP. We have used MalP as a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of maltodextrin synthesis. The 2.0A crystal structure of the MalP/Glc1P binary complex shows that the Glc1P substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian GP, with the phosphate group not in close contact with the 5'-phosphate group of the essential pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor. In the active MalP enzyme, the residue Arg569 stabilizes the negative-charged Glc1P, whereas in the inactive form of GP this key residue is held away from the catalytic site by loop 280s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is required for activation. The comparison between MalP structures shows that His377, through a hydrogen bond with the 6-hydroxyl group of Glc1P substrate, triggers a conformational change of the 380s loop. This mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the MalP ternary complex. The structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides (either maltotetraose, G4 or maltopentaose, G5) into MalP/Glc1P crystals show the formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain. These structures, refined at 1.8A and at 2.2A, confirm that only when an oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will Glc1P bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the PLP 5' phosphate group and promote catalysis. The relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can diffuse quickly into the MalP/Glc1P crystals and the enzymatic reaction can occur without significant crystal damage. These structures obtained before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular movie. This movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein, involving mainly Arg569, which tracks the substrate phosphate group.

12383039|t|The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium in healthy volunteers.
12383039|a|OBJECTIVE: Fondaparinux sodium is the first in a new class of synthetic factor Xa inhibitors that binds reversibly with high affinity to antithrombin III. It has been investigated for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders and approved for use at a dose of 2.5mg once daily in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery. The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium were determined in eight studies in young and elderly healthy volunteers. RESULTS: After a 2.5mg subcutaneous dose to young volunteers, absolute bioavailability was 100% and absorption was rapid and complete [peak plasma concentration (C(max)) 0.34 mg/L occurred at approximately 2 hours]. Within- and total-subject variability estimates were small: 5.5 and 11.6%, respectively, for C(max )and 4.4 and 17.5% for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Steady state was obtained after the third or fourth once-daily dose, with a 1.3-fold increase in C(max) and AUC. Distribution volume (7 to 11L) was limited to blood volume. There was no evidence of metabolism. Fondaparinux sodium was almost completely excreted in urine as unchanged compound (64 to 77% of the dose was recovered at 72 hours after administration). Plasma clearance was 5.1 to 7.9 ml/min, renal clearance 4.0 to 7.9 ml/min, and the terminal half-life was 17 hours in young volunteers and 21 hours in elderly volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium were linear in the range 2 to 8mg subcutaneously and 2 to 20mg intravenously. Pharmacokinetics observed in healthy elderly volunteers were consistent with findings in young male volunteers. CONCLUSION: The favourable pharmacokinetic profile of fondaparinux sodium is likely to play an important role in the major advance that the drug represents in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders.

12409268|t|Molecular analysis of PCCB gene in Korean patients with propionic acidemia.
12409268|a|Propionic acidemia (PA) is an autosomal recessive inborn error in the catabolism of methionine, isoleucine, threonine, and valine, odd-numbered chain length fatty acids and cholesterol. Clinical symptoms are very heterogeneous and present as a severe neonatal-onset or a late-onset form. It is caused by a deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC, EC 6.4.1.3), a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA. PCC is a heteropolymeric enzyme composed of alpha- and beta-subunits. A greater heterogeneity is observed in the PCCA gene, while for the PCCB gene, a limited number of mutations is responsible for the majority of the alleles characterized in both Caucasian and Oriental populations. We identified eight Korean patients with PA by organic acid analysis confirmed in five patients by the PCC enzyme assay in the lymphoblasts. Two neonatal-onset patients showed undetectable PCC activities while three cases with residual enzyme activities had relatively late manifestations. In the molecular analysis, we identified five novel mutations, Y439C, 1527del3, 1357insT, IVS12-8T-->A, and 31del10, and one known mutation, T428I in PCCB gene. Alleleic frequency of T428I in Korean patients with PA was 56.3% in this study. Two neonatal-onset patients with null enzyme activities were homozygotes with 1527del3 and T428I, respectively. This finding implies that T428I and 1527del3 mutation could be responsible for their severe clinical courses and null enzyme activities. The mRNA of PCCB gene in T428I and 1527del3 homozygotes were normal but in Western blot analysis, the betaPCC-subunit was only absent in 1527del3 homozygote patient suggesting different molecular pathology.

12445705|t|Atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine, iloperidone, and melperone, preferentially increase dopamine and acetylcholine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex: role of 5-HT1A receptor agonism.
12445705|a|Preferential increases in both cortical dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) release have been proposed to distinguish the atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone from typical APDs such as haloperidol. Although only clozapine and ziprasidone are directly acting 5-HT(1A) agonists, WAY100635, a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, partially attenuates these atypical APD-induced increases in cortical DA release that may be due to combined 5-HT(2A) and D(2) blockade. However, WAY100635 does not attenuate clozapine-induced cortical ACh release. The present study determined whether quetiapine, iloperidone and melperone, 5-HT(2A)/D(2) antagonist atypical APDs, also increase cortical DA and ACh release, and whether these effects are related to 5-HT(1A) agonism. Quetiapine (30 mg/kg), iloperidone (1-10 mg/kg), and melperone (3-10 mg/kg) increased DA and ACh release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Iloperidone (10 mg/kg) and melperone (10 mg/kg), but not quetiapine (30 mg/kg), produced an equivalent or a smaller increase in DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), respectively, compared to the mPFC, whereas none of them increased ACh release in the NAC. WAY100635 (0.2 mg/kg), which alone did not affect DA or ACh release, partially attenuated quetiapine (30 mg/kg)-, iloperidone (10 mg/kg)- and melperone (10 mg/kg)-induced DA release in the mPFC. WAY100635 also partially attenuated quetiapine (30 mg/kg)-induced ACh release in the mPFC, but not that induced by iloperidone (10 mg/kg) or melperone (10 mg/kg). These results indicate that quetiapine, iloperidone and melperone preferentially increase DA release in the mPFC, compared to the NAC via a 5-HT(1A)-related mechanism. However, 5-HT(1A) agonism may be important only for quetiapine-induced ACh release.

12545144|t|Effects of age and sex on the disposition of retigabine.
12545144|a|BACKGROUND: The novel antiepileptic drug retigabine is the first selective M-current potassium channel opener for KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 channels. Retigabine undergoes phase II metabolism (N-glucuronidation, acetylation) exclusively and renal excretion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of age and sex on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. METHODS: Healthy young (age range, 18-40 years) and elderly (age range, 66-81 years) white subjects (12 men and 12 women in each group) received a single 200-mg oral dose of retigabine. After dosing, blood was collected over a 72-hour period to determine plasma concentrations of retigabine and its acetylated metabolite, AWD21-360. Pharmacokinetics was compared for age group and sex by ANOVA. RESULTS: In young men, retigabine was rapidly absorbed, with the maximum concentration occurring within 2 hours, and was eliminated with an apparent clearance of 0.67 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) and a mean terminal half-life of 8.5 hours. Subjects were similarly exposed to AWD21-360. Compared with young men, young women had higher retigabine maximum concentration (56%) and exposure (20%) but similar clearance (0.68 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)); these differences were related to differences in body weight. Although maximum concentration was similar in elderly subjects, retigabine elimination was slower (30% lower apparent clearance normalized for weight), resulting in higher exposure (42%) and a longer half-life (30%). Because phase II metabolism is scarcely affected by age, these differences may be related to the known decline of renal function with age. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no substantial sex-related differences in the disposition of retigabine, a relevant decrease in clearance resulting in higher exposure occurs in elderly patients. The results suggest that decline of renal function with age may account for some of the observed changes.

12588370|t|Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition does not affect the healing of cutaneous full-thickness incisional wounds in SKH-1 mice.
12588370|a|BACKGROUND: The inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is upregulated in inflammatory diseases, as well as in epithelial cancers, and has an established role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. OBJECTIVE: Because of these physiological effects and the widespread use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, we wanted to determine if inhibition of COX-2 would affect incisional skin wound healing. METHODS: Using a cutaneous full-thickness, sutured, incisional wound model in hairless SKH-1 mice, we evaluated the role of COX-2 in the wound healing process by comparing the effects of a nonselective COX inhibitor, diclofenac, with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-791. Healing was monitored for up to 28 days postincision histologically and for recovery of wound strength. RESULTS: COX-2 expression was observed over the first week of healing, peaking at day 3 and was not affected by treatment with the selective COX-2 or nonselective COX inhibitors. Infiltrating macrophages, as well as keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts at the wound site, expressed COX-2. Neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition had a significant effect on the macroscopic or microscopic morphology of the wounds, whereas dexamethasone treatment resulted in epidermal and granulation tissue atrophy. In addition, neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition altered keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, dermal angiogenesis or the recovery of wound tensile strength, whereas dexamethasone reduced the tensile strength of the wounds by 30-38% throughout the healing period. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that selective COX-2 inhibition does not affect the healing of surgical skin wounds.

12623106|t|Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of novel radiotracers for the in vivo imaging of the norepinephrine transporter.
12623106|a|The (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of 2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]morpholine (MeNER) have been radiolabelled with carbon-11 in good yield and at high specific activity. These radiotracers are close analogues of reboxetine, a potent and selective ligand for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). They were examined as potential ligands for imaging NET in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The in vivo brain distribution of both [(11)C]-labeled enantiomers were evaluated in rats. Following tail-vein injection of the (R,R)-enantiomer regional brain uptake and washout of radioactivity was homogeneous at all time points examined (5-60 min). In contrast, administration of the (S,S)-enantiomer produced a heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in brain with highest uptake in the hypothalamus, a NET rich region, and lowest uptake in the striatum, a brain region devoid of NET. Hypothalamus to striatum ratios of 2.5 to one were achieved at 60 min post injection of (S,S)-[(11)C]-MeNER. Pre-injection of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, reboxetine or desipramine, reduced hypothalamus to striatum ratios to near unity while reuptake inhibitors of dopamine and serotonin had no significant effect on binding. In vitro autoradiography studies (rat brain slices) with (S,S)-[(11)C]-MeNER produced a regional distribution pattern that was consistent with the reported distribution of NET. (S,S)-[(11)C]-MeNER has the potential to be the first successful PET ligand to image NET.

12657913|t|Histamine H1-receptor antagonists, promethazine and homochlorcyclizine, increase the steady-state plasma concentrations of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol.
12657913|a|The effects of histamine H1-receptor antagonists, promethazine and homochlorcyclizine, both of which are inhibitors of CYP2D6, on the steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol were studied in 23 schizophrenic inpatients receiving haloperidol, 12 to 36 mg/d, for 2 to 29 weeks. Promethazine, 150 mg/d, in 11 patients and homochlorcyclizine, 60 mg/d, in the others were coadministered for at least 1 week. Blood sampling was performed before and during coadministration of promethazine or homochlorcyclizine and 1 week after the discontinuation, together with clinical assessments by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Udvalg for kliniske undersogelser (UKU) side effect rating scale. The Css (mean +/- SD) of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol during promethazine coadministration (27.6 +/- 24.9 and 8.6 +/- 13.2 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those before the coadministration (12.7 +/- 10.8 and 5.0 +/- 6.0 ng/mL; P < 0.01) or 1 week after the discontinuation (15.6 +/- 14.8 and 5.8 +/- 7.9 ng/mL; P < 0.05). The Css of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol during homochlorcyclizine coadministration (14.9 +/- 8.1 and 6.4 +/- 5.4 ng/mL) were also significantly higher than those before the coadministration (10.9 +/- 7.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.6 ng/mL; P < 0.01) or 1 week after the discontinuation (12.9 +/- 7.4 and 4.8 +/- 4.1 ng/mL; P < 0.05). No change in BPRS or UKU score was found throughout the study. Thus, the current study suggests that coadministration of clinical doses of promethazine and homochlorcyclizine increases the Css of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol via the inhibitory effects on the CYP2D6-catalyzed metabolism of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol.

12679340|t|Yeast epiarginase regulation, an enzyme-enzyme activity control: identification of residues of ornithine carbamoyltransferase and arginase responsible for enzyme catalytic and regulatory activities.
12679340|a|In the presence of ornithine and arginine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) and arginase form a one-to-one enzyme complex in which the activity of OTCase is inhibited whereas arginase remains catalytically active. The mechanism by which these nonallosteric enzymes form a stable complex triggered by the binding of their respective substrates raises the question of how such a cooperative association is induced. Analyses of mutations in both enzymes identify residues that are required for their association, some of them being important for catalysis. In arginase, two cysteines at the C terminus of the protein are crucial for its epiarginase function but not for its catalytic activity and trimeric structure. In OTCase, mutations of putative ornithine binding residues, Asp-182, Asn-184, Asn-185, Cys-289, and Glu-256 greatly reduced the affinity for ornithine and impaired the interaction with arginase. The four lysine residues located in the SMG loop, Lys-260, Lys-263, Lys-265, and Lys-268, also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of OTCase to ornithine and to arginase and appear to be involved in transducing and enhancing the signal given by ornithine for the closure of the catalytic domain.

In the present study, we examined whether a CysLT antagonist modifies the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. Pranlukast hydrate, a CysLT antagonist, blocked the chemotactic response and adhesion of eosinophils induced by LTD4. On the other hand, pranlukast did not modify the eosinophil spontaneous adhesion to the resting or IL-4 plus TNF-alpha-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells. Similarly, pranlukast did not modulate IL-5- or FMLP-activated eosinophil adhesion to the resting endothelial cells. Finally, pranlukast did not modify the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells stimulated with endothelial activating cytokines. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of CysLT antagonist on eosinophil accumulation in the asthmatic airways involves mechanisms other than the adhesive interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells.

12699389|t|Comparison of in vitro P-glycoprotein screening assays: recommendations for their use in drug discovery.
12699389|a|The ATP-dependent drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) affects the absorption and disposition of many compounds. P-gp may also play role in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Therefore, it is important to find potential substrates or inhibitors of P-gp early in the drug discovery process. To identify compounds that interact with this transporter, several P-gp assays were validated and compared by testing a set of 28 reference compounds, including inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The assays included in silico predictions, inhibition assays (based on cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 or calcein AM), and functional assays (ATPase activity assay and transcellular transport assay, the latter for a subset of compounds). In addition, species differences were studied in an indirect fluorescence indicator screening assay and test systems expressing porcine, mouse, or human P-gp. Our results suggest that several P-gp assays should be used in combination to classify compounds as substrates or inhibitors of P-gp. Recommendations are given on screening strategies which can be applied to different phases of the drug discovery and development process.

12783542|t|Incorporation of trifluoroisoleucine into proteins in vivo.
12783542|a|Two fluorinated derivatives of isoleucine: d,l-2-amino-3-trifluoromethyl pentanoic acid (3TFI, 2) and d,l-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoro-3-methyl pentanoic acid (5TFI, 3) were prepared. 5TFI was incorporated into a model target protein, murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR), in an isoleucine auxotrophic Escherichia coli host strain suspended in 5TFI-supplemented minimal medium depleted of isoleucine. Incorporation of 5TFI was confirmed by tryptic peptide analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of the protein product. Amino acid analysis showed that more than 93% of the encoded isoleucine residues were replaced by 5TFI. Measurement of the rate of activation of 5TFI by the E. coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) yielded a specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) 134-fold lower than that for isoleucine. 5TFI was successfully introduced into the cytokine murine interleukin-2 (mIL-2) at the encoded isoleucine positions. The concentration of fluorinated protein that elicits 50% of the maximal proliferative response is 3.87 ng/mL, about 30% higher than that of wild-type mIL-2 (EC(50) = 2.70 ng/mL). The maximal responses are equivalent for the fluorinated and wild-type cytokines, indicating that fluorinated proteins can fold into stable and functional structures. 3TFI yielded no evidence for in vivo incorporation into recombinant proteins, and no evidence for activation by IleRS in vitro.

1280065|t|Analysis of plasmin binding and urokinase activation of plasminogen bound to the Heymann nephritis autoantigen, gp330.
1280065|a|Previously, we demonstrated that the Heymann nephritis autoantigen, gp330, can serve as a receptor site for plasminogen. This binding was not significantly inhibited by the lysine analogue epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), indicating that plasminogen binding was not just through lysine binding sites as suggested for other plasminogen binding sites. We now report that once plasminogen is bound to gp330, it can be converted to its active form of plasmin by urokinase. This conversion of plasminogen to plasmin proceeds at a faster rate when plasminogen is first prebound to gp330. Although there is a proportional increase in the Vmax of the urokinase-catalyzed reaction with increasing gp330 concentrations, no change in Km was observed. Once activated, plasmin remains bound to gp330 in an active state capable of cleaving the chromogenic tripeptide, S-2251. The binding of plasmin to gp330 did not significantly change its enzymatic activity; however, gp330 did have a stabilizing effect on plasmin activity at 37 degrees C. While bound to gp330, plasmin is protected from inactivation by its natural inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin. The binding of plasmin to gp330 as analyzed by ELISA was shown to be time dependent, reversible, saturable, and specific for gp330. Inhibition of binding of both plasminogen and plasmin to gp330 by benzamidine was similar, although EACA inhibited the binding of plasmin to gp330 slightly more than the binding of plasminogen to gp330. These results indicate that the binding of plasminogen to gp330 serves as an effective means of increasing the rate of plasmin production on the glomerular and tubular epithelial cell surface while protecting the active plasmin from natural inhibitors.

12818701|t|Functional characterization of alpha-adrenoceptors mediating pupillary dilation in rats.
12818701|a|Previously, we reported that the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor, but not the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor, mediates pupillary dilation elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation in rats. This study was undertaken to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating pupillary dilation in response to both neural and agonist activation. Pupillary dilator response curves were generated by intravenous injection of norepinephrine in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors was established as mydriatic responses were inhibited by systemic administration of nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, phentolamine (0.3-3 mg/kg) and phenoxybenzamine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), as well as by the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.3 mg/kg). The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (0.5 mg/kg), was without antagonistic effects. alpha(1A)-Adrenoceptor selective antagonists, 2-([2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl]aminomethyl)-1,4-benzodioxane (WB-4101; 0.1-1 mg/kg) and 5-methylurapidil (0.1-1 mg/kg), the alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, 4-amino-2-[4-[1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-2(S)- [[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]carbonyl]-piperazinyl]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (L-765314; 0.3-1 mg/kg), as well as the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, 8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione (BMY-7378; 1 mg/kg), were used to delineate the adrenoceptor subtypes involved. Mydriatic responses to norepinephrine were significantly antagonized by intravenous administration of both WB-4101 and 5-methylurapidil, but neither by L-765314 nor by BMY-7378. L-765314 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.v.) was also ineffective in inhibiting the mydriasis evoked by cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. These results suggest that alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors do not mediate sympathetic mydriasis in rats, and that the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor is the exclusive subtype mediating mydriatic responses in this species.

12824918|t|Colon cancer cells with high invasive potential are susceptible to induction of apoptosis by a selective COX-2 inhibitor.
12824918|a|Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression has been shown to correlate with the invasiveness of colon cancer cells. To further investigate this positive correlation and its possible therapeutic implications, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, was tested on three variants of HT-29 colon cancer cell lines, HT-29/Inv1, HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3, with graded increases of in vitro Matrigel invasive potential and COX-2 expression levels. HT-29 variants with higher invasive potential were found to be more sensitive to etodolac by in vitro growth inhibition assays, the estimated LD(50) being 0.5 mM for highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3 cells, 0.6 mM for slightly less invasive HT-29/Inv1, and 1.8 mM for the parental HT-29. Treatment of the highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and Inv3 variants with as little as 0.1 mM etodolac in the growth medium produced signs of apoptosis, as detected by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay. In vivo experiments in SCID mice showed that etolodac inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors induced by HT-29/Inv3 cells significantly more than those by the parental HT-29 cells. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors have a potential role in prevention of tumor invasion in colon cancer patients.

12827214|t|Pharmacological characterization of unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney.
12827214|a|In human kidney, we found unique prazosin-binding sites that were insensitive to phentolamine and were thus unlikely to be alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. As the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites was prevented by 100 microM guanabenz, the insensitive sites were evaluated by subtracting [(3)H]prazosin binding in the presence of 100 microM guanabenz from that in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine. [(3)H]Prazosin bound to the phentolamine-insensitive sites monophasically with a high affinity (pK(d); 9.1+/-0.08, n=8), and the B(max) value (814+/-204 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=8) was more than ten times that of the phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pK(d)=9.9+/-0.13, B(max)=66+/-23 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=7). The phentolamine-insensitive sites in human kidney were highly sensitive to other quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin and doxazosin. However, other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, WB4101 and corynanthine) did not inhibit the binding at a range of concentrations that generally exhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, and noradrenaline, rauwolscine and propranolol were without effect on the [(3)H]prazosin binding. On the other hand, ligands for the renal Na(+)-transporter (amiloride and triamterene) and for imidazoline recognition sites (guanabenz, guanfacine and agmatine) displaced the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites at micromolar concentrations. Photoaffinity labeling with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin showed phentolamine-insensitive labeling at around 100 kDa, a molecular size larger than that of human alpha(1a)- and alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors expressed in 293 cells (50-60 and 70-80 kDa, respectively) on electrophoresis. In contrast, there was no detectable phentolamine-insensitive binding site but were phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human liver (pK(d)=10.0+/-0.06, B(max)=44+/-6 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=3). Phentolamine-insensitive prazosin binding sites were also detected in rabbit kidney (approximately 50% of specific binding sites) but were minor in rat kidney (less than 20%). In conclusion, there are unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney, the pharmacological profiles of which were distinct from those of known adrenoceptors.

12837768|t|chi-Conopeptide MrIA partially overlaps desipramine and cocaine binding sites on the human norepinephrine transporter.
12837768|a|The interactions of chi-conopeptide MrIA with the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) were investigated by determining the effects of hNET point mutations on the inhibitory potency of MrIA. The mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in COS-7 cells. The potency of MrIA was greater for inhibition of uptake by hNET of [3H]norepinephrine (Ki 1.89 microM) than [3H]dopamine (Ki 4.33 microM), and the human dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter were not inhibited by MrIA (to 7 microM). Of 18 mutations where hNET amino acid residues were exchanged with those of the human dopamine transporter, MrIA had increased potency for inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake for three mutations (in predicted extracellular loops 3 and 4 and transmembrane domain (TMD) 8) and decreased potency for one mutation (in TMD6 and intracellular loop (IL) 3). Of the 12 additional mutations in TMDs 2, 4, 5, and 11 and IL1, three mutations (in TMD2 and IL1) had reduced MrIA inhibitory potency. All of the other mutations tested had no influence on MrIA potency. A comparison of the results with previous data for desipramine and cocaine inhibition of norepinephrine uptake by the mutant hNETs reveals that MrIA binding to hNET occurs at a site that is distinct from but overlaps with the binding sites for tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine.

1284246|t|The primary structure of porcine aminoacylase 1 deduced from cDNA sequence.
1284246|a|A cDNA encoding the complete amino acid sequence of aminoacylase 1 (N-acylamino acid aminohydrolase, ACY-1) [EC 3.5.1.14], a dimeric metalloprotein having two Zn2+ in the molecule, which catalyzes the deacylation of N-acylated L-amino acids except L-aspartic acid, has been isolated from porcine kidney lambda gt10 cDNA library and sequenced. From sequence analysis of the cDNA and the N- and C-terminal amino acid analyses of the purified protein, it is deduced that porcine kidney ACY-1 consists of two identical subunits (M(r) 45,260), each of which consists of a single chain of 406 amino acids with acetylalanine at the N-terminus. A cDNA encoding porcine liver ACY-1 was also cloned. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA from porcine liver was identical to that deduced for porcine kidney ACY-1. Northern blot analysis suggested that ACY-1 is more highly expressed in kidney than in liver. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of porcine ACY-1 with those of other Zn2+-binding metalloenzymes showed no significant homologies in either the overall sequence or the consensus sequences for the metal binding sites. This indicates that ACY-1 is a new type of metalloprotein.

12844134|t|Beta 1-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and antihypertensive response to metoprolol.
12844134|a|OBJECTIVES: Marked interpatient variability exists in blood pressure response to beta-blocker monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the gene for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor are associated with antihypertensive response to metoprolol in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. METHODS: Forty hypertensive men and women aged 35 to 65 years were studied. Baseline studies included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Patients took 50 mg metoprolol twice daily with weekly titration to response or 200 mg twice daily. After a minimum of 4 weeks at stable dose, treatment phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated. The codon 49 and 389 genotypes for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor were determined by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multilinear regression was performed to determine the impact of genotype and other variables on blood pressure response to metoprolol. RESULTS: Patients homozygous for Arg at codon 389 had a nearly 3-fold greater reduction in daytime diastolic blood pressure (-13.3% +/- 8.4% versus -4.5% +/- 8.2%, P =.0018) compared with those who carried the variant allele. The haplotype pair (diplotype) for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was also a significant predictor of response, with patients having the Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 diplotype demonstrating a decline in blood pressure of 14.7 mm Hg versus 0.5 mm Hg in patients with the Gly49Arg389/Ser49Gly389 diplotype. In multiregression analysis, baseline daytime diastolic blood pressure, codon 389 genotype, and codon 49 genotype were significant predictors of blood pressure after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms are important determinants of antihypertensive response to metoprolol. In the future, codon 49 and 389 genotypes or beta(1)-adrenergic receptor haplotypes might be used to predict the diastolic blood pressure response to metoprolol in patients with hypertension.

12901032|t|Interaction of rofecoxib and celecoxib with warfarin.
12901032|a|The interaction of celecoxib and rofecoxib with warfarin was studied. Patients stable on warfarin therapy and concurrently taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor comparator (traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, salsalate, or acetaminophen) randomly received celecoxib 200 mg/day or rofecoxib 25 mg/day for three weeks. After a one-week washout period, the patients were crossed over to treatment with the opposite COX-2 inhibitor for three more weeks. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of therapy with each COX-2 inhibitor by testing blood samples obtained by finger stick. Data for 16 patients were analyzed. The INR increased by 13%, 6%, and 5% on average in patients taking celecoxib at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and by 5%, 9%, and 5% in patients taking rofecoxib. Changes in the INR were statistically significant at week 1 for celecoxib and at week 2 for rofecoxib. Of the 12 subjects who had a clinically significant > or = 15% change in the INR while receiving either COX-2 inhibitor, 4 showed this change for both agents. Adverse drug reactions were similar for each COX-2 inhibitor, but the rate of edema requiring medical intervention was higher in the rofecoxib group. Significant increases in the INR were observed in patients who were stable on warfarin therapy after the addition of therapy with rofecoxib or celecoxib.

12927226|t|AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain.
12927226|a|INTRODUCTION: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated to reduce total mortality in cardiovascular diseases. This advantage was attributed in part to changes of autonomic cardiovascular control, exemplified by an increase of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex gain (BRG). We sought to assess the effects of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker eprosartan on HRV and BRG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized cross-over design 25 young males took eprosartan (600 mg/day) and placebo each for a period of 7 days with a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks in between. At the end of the intake phases simultaneous recordings of arterial blood pressure (AP; Finapres) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were taken. Power spectra of HRV and arterial blood pressure variability (APV) were calculated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and served to calculate BRG. Ang-II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Eprosartan tended to lower mean AP, it slightly increased heart rate (HR) (p<0.05), and markedly increased circulating Ang-II levels (p<0.01). Eprosartan diminished the total power of HRV (p<0.05) and the BRG (p<0.01). The low/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HRV and the APV were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain. We speculate that these findings are due to the marked increase in circulating angiotensin II (Ang II). Further studies are needed to clarify whether angiotensin type 1 (AT1) blockers with potential actions inside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may have different effects on HRV and BRG.

1318989|t|Further characterization of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) regulatory activity, I: Effect on opioid- and alpha 2-mediated supraspinal antinociception in mice.
1318989|a|Picomol doses of the acetylated derivative of beta-endorphin-(1-31), injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) in mice, reduced the analgesic activity of morphine, etorphine and beta-endorphin-(1-31), while the efficiency of DAGO and DADLE in producing analgesia was enhanced. The effects of the delta agonists DPDPE and [D-Ala2]-Deltorphin II were not altered by this treatment. After alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) injection, morphine antagonized the analgesia of DAGO. The regulatory effect of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) was exhibited when giving the peptide both before (up to 24 h) and after the opioids. Naloxone did not prevent or reverse that modulatory activity; moreover, pretreatment with the acetylated peptide did not change the pA2 value displayed by the antagonist at the mu receptor. The antinociceptive activity of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was also increased in mice treated with alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31). The reducing activity of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) upon morphine- and beta-endorphin-induced analgesia was not exhibited in mice undergoing treatment with pertussis toxin or N-ethylmaleimide, agents known to impair the function of Gi/Go transducer proteins. However, the enhancing activity displayed by this peptide upon DAGO- DADLE and clonidine-evoked antinociception was still manifested. These results confirm and strengthen the idea of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) acting as a non-competitive regulator of mu opioid- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated supraspinal antinociception. A neural substrate acted on by both receptors (likely Gi/Go transducer proteins) appears to be involved in the effects of that neuropeptide.

1322429|t|Effects of loperamide on the human hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo and in vitro.
1322429|a|Loperamide, an opiate agonist of high specificity for mu-receptors, was recently reported to suppress ACTH and cortisol levels in normal subjects, but not in patients with proven ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease. However, there is little information on the site of action of loperamide in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis of man. We investigated the effect of loperamide on pituitary hormone secretion in vivo and in vitro. In seven normal subjects, basal ACTH plasma levels were significantly suppressed 3 h after loperamide administration (16 mg, orally) from 5 +/- 1 to 2 +/- 0 pmol/L (P less than 0.0001). After the combined pituitary stimulation test (100 micrograms human CRH, 100 micrograms GnRH, 100 micrograms GH-releasing hormone, and 200 micrograms TRH), the ACTH peak (maximum increase at 30 min) was significantly blunted by loperamide from 9 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 pmol/L (P less than 0.001) and the area under the curve of ACTH from 0-120 min was reduced from 35 +/- 5 to 23 +/- 4 pmol/L.2 h (P less than 0.05). In the insulin-hypoglycemia test (0.15 IU/kg BW), neither the ACTH peak nor the area under the curve of ACTH was affected by loperamide. In six patients with Cushing's disease and one patient with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic failure, neither basal ACTH and cortisol levels nor CRH-stimulated levels were influenced by loperamide. In four cultured human corticotropic adenomas, loperamide was not able to reduce basal and CRH-induced ACTH secretion. In summary, loperamide is able to reduce basal and CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol levels in normal subjects, but not in patients with Cushing's disease or secondary adrenal failure of hypothalamic origin. Loperamide has no significant effect on insulin-hypoglycemia-induced ACTH and cortisol levels and, therefore, no effect on stress-induced elevation of cortisol levels. Loperamide might act at a suprapituitary site in man in vivo, but, nevertheless, a pituitary site cannot be excluded.

1326878|t|Effects of nedocromil sodium on the binding of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in human neutrophils.
1326878|a|In the present study the inhibition by nedocromil sodium of the specific receptor binding of FMLP was evaluated in human neutrophils (PMNs) using a FMLP-(3H) binding assay. The time course of the binding was markedly influenced by nedocromil sodium used at a concentration of 300 microM. No significant inhibition was obtained when the cells were treated with nedocromil sodium 3 microM or with sodium cromoglycate 300 microM. FMLP binding is essentially eliminated by the highest dose of nedocromil sodium. The biologic meaning of this effect in asthmatic patients should be further evaluated.

1329582|t|Effects of nedocromil sodium and WEB 2086 on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration through cellular and noncellular barriers.
1329582|a|Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is an effective therapeutic agent against asthma and has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vitro; however, its mode of action is yet to be described fully. Using an in vitro assay designed to mimic the extravasation of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation through cellular barriers to sites of inflammation, the effect of nedocromil sodium on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration was examined. We also examined the effects of WEB 2086, a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, in parallel. Neutrophils and the cellular barrier were pretreated and/or co-incubated with nedocromil or WEB 2086 and the effects on neutrophil chemotaxis measured. In all treatments, nedocromil did not significantly affect chemotaxis through cellular or noncellular barriers to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), or PAF. In contrast, WEB 2086 inhibited PAF-induced neutrophil migration through both naked filters and endothelial and epithelial monolayers cultured on these filters. We conclude that while nedocromil has been shown to have inhibitory effects on neutrophils and is an effective therapeutic agent for asthma and inflammatory conditions, its activity is not primarily mediated by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Platelet-activating factor antagonists may partially be effective in asthma through inhibitory effects on neutrophil chemotaxis.

1351412|t|Ocular beta-blockers in glaucoma management. Clinical pharmacological aspects.
1351412|a|Topical beta-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by blockade of sympathetic nerve endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production. Two types of topical beta-blockers are available for use in glaucoma: nonselective, which block both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors; and cardioselective, which block only beta 1-receptors. Of the beta-Blockers commercially available, timolol, levobunolol, metipranolol and carteolol are nonselective, and betaxolol is cardioselective. Twice-daily timolol is probably the most effective agent in lowering IOP, although levobunolol is equally effective and can be used once daily with little difference in effect. Carteolol is used twice daily and any theoretical advantage in diminished side effects conferred by its partial beta-agonist activity compared with timolol has not been fully substantiated. Metipranolol is effective twice daily and does not have partial beta-agonist activity. Betaxolol has an effect comparable to timolol in lowering IOP, but is less effective in some patients. beta-Blockers can be used with other antiglaucoma medications, but their combined action with epinephrine (adrenaline) is suspect, particularly in the case of the nonselective beta-blockers, and the effect should be assessed in patients on an individual basis. Local stinging can be a problem in some patients with betaxolol. The most serious side effects of beta-blockers are the exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients. Betaxolol seems relatively free of adverse respiratory effects, although this may be dose-related and extreme caution should still be exercised in patients with any history of respiratory illness. Because of the lower risk of precipitating side effects, betaxolol is probably the beta-blocker of first choice for use in glaucoma; timolol or levobunolol are reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to betaxolol and are quite free of respiratory disease.

1359745|t|5-Lipoxygenase inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
1359745|a|The unique role of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in the production of leukotrienes (LTs) makes it a likely target for biochemical manipulation. The rationale for using 5-LO inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is based on the increased generation of LTs in the inflamed mucosa, LTB4 being the most potent chemotactic and chemokinetic metabolite of arachidonic acid. Furthermore, conventional drugs, such as corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, and 5-aminosalicylic acid, inhibit LT production and specific 5-LO inhibition accelerates healing in animal models of acute colitis. The compounds identified as 5-LO inhibitors can be divided into antioxidants, substrate-analogous, and a large miscellaneous group of inhibitors, where hydroxamic acids are potent and more selective inhibitors of 5-LO. The benzothiophene hydroxyurea, zileuton, is the first selective 5-LO inhibitor evaluated for the treatment of patients with IBD. An 800-mg oral dose of zileuton was shown to reduce LTB4, but not prostaglandin E2, concentrations by 75-85% in rectal dialysates from patients with active ulcerative colitis. The clinical efficacy of zileuton 800 mg b.i.d. has also been tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in similar patients. Zileuton significantly improved the symptom scores and the histology score, but not the sigmoidoscopy score, compared to pretreatment conditions and with response to placebo, the beneficial effects being most pronounced in patients not receiving concomitant sulphasalazine treatment. The mean inhibition of LTB4 in the target tissue of inflammation was 70%. The proof that any putative 5-LO inhibitor is blocking LT production is an important stage in assessing any such drug. The main disadvantage of existing new LT inhibitors relates to the high potency of LTs, and unless a higher level of inhibition can be achieved, endogenous LTs may still be present in sufficient amounts to produce their effects.

14506245|t|Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-alpha-activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 is critical for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity independent of p53.
14506245|a|Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells. PDGF AA functions as a "competent factor" that stimulates cell cycle entry but requires additional (progression) factors in serum to transit the cell cycle beyond the G1/S checkpoint. Unlike PDGF AA, PDGF B-chain (c-sis) homodimer (PDGF BB) and its viral counterpart v-sis can serve as both competent and progression factors. PDGF BB activates alpha- and beta-receptor subunits (alpha-PDGFR and beta-PDGFR) and induces phenotypic transformation in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas PDGF AA activates alpha-PDGFR only and fails to induce transformation. We showed previously that alpha-PDGFR antagonizes beta-PDGFR-mediated transformation through activation of stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1, whereas both alpha-PDGFR and beta-PDGFR induce mitogenic signals. These studies revealed a striking feature of PDGF signaling; the specificity and the strength of the PDGF growth signal is modulated by alpha-PDGFR-mediated simultaneous activation of growth stimulatory and inhibitory signals, whereas beta-PDGFR mainly induces a growth-promoting signal. Here we demonstrate that PDGF BB activation of beta-PDGFR alone results in more efficient cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase than PDGF BB activation of both alpha-PDGFR and beta-PDGFR. PDGF AA activation of alpha-PDGFR or PDGF BB activation of both alpha- and beta-PDGFRs up-regulates expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, an inhibitor of cell cycle-dependent kinases and a downstream mediator of the tumor suppressor gene product p53. However, beta-PDGFR activation alone fails to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. We also demonstrate that alpha-PDGFR-activated JNK-1 is a critical signaling component for PDGF induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity. The ability of PDGF/JNK-1 to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity is independent of p53, although the overall p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activities are greatly reduced in the absence of p53. These results provide a molecular basis for differential regulation of the cell cycle and transformation by alpha- and beta-PDGFRs.

14564902|t|Searching for preventive measures of cardiovascular events in aged Japanese taxi drivers--the daily rhythm of cardiovascular risk factors during a night duty day.
14564902|a|Previous studies have shown that Japanese taxi drivers are exposed to more risk factors and have a higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease than other occupational groups. We investigated the effect of night taxi driving with a view to preventing acute events of cardiovascular disease among aged taxi drivers. Twenty-nine taxi drivers (41-67 years old) were examined for urine normetanephrine/creatinine, von Willebrand factor, anti-thrombin III, t-plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-complex, hematocrit, blood glucose and blood pressure in the morning and at midnight during a duty day and in the following morning. At the same time, the blood pressure and blood glucose of 46 taxi drivers (43-67 years old) in the morning after a night duty with little sleep and in the morning after daytime work and subsequent night sleep were compared. The results obtained indicate that the aggravation of sympathetic nervous system functions with disturbed circadian rhythms, increased blood coagulation and blood concentration, endothelial injury and the elevation of blood glucose at midnight or the next morning were induced by their night work. These conditions are supposed to favour acute vascular events in aged taxi drivers. Preventive measures considered include social support for anticoagulant food and water intake, short exercise and walking as well as taking a rest and a nap during night work.

14583450|t|The human ribonucleotide reductase subunit hRRM2 complements p53R2 in response to UV-induced DNA repair in cells with mutant p53.
14583450|a|Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is responsible for the de novo conversion of the ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair. RR consists of two subunits, hRRM1 and hRRM2. p53R2 is a new RR family member. Because the majority of human tumors possess mutant p53, it is important to know the molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 regulates RR and to what extent. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of p53R2 and hRRM2 after UV treatment in human prostate cancer PC3 cells, which possess mutant p53 with a truncated COOH-terminal, and in human oropharyngeal cancer KB cells, which possess wild-type p53. p53R2 (analyzed by Western blot and standardized relative to Coomassie Blue-stained band) was down-regulated in PC3 cells and up-regulated in KB cells after UV exposure. In contrast, hRRM2 was up-regulated by UV in both PC3 cells and KB cells. hRRM2 and p53R2 mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot, and the results paralleled that of the Western blot. Coimmunoprecipitation assays using agarose-conjugated goat antihuman RRM1 antibody confirmed that the p53R2 binding to hRRM1 decreased in PC3 cells but increased in KB cells after UV treatment. hRRM2 binding to hRRM1 increased in both cell lines under the same conditions. These results suggest that PC3 cells are deficient in both transcription of p53R2 and binding to hRRM1 in response to UV irradiation. Confocal microscopy further confirmed that these findings were not due to translocation of hRRM2 and p53R2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. RR activity was measured following UV treatment and shown to increase in PC3 cells. It was unchanged in proportional of KB cells. The RR activity is consistent with the expression of hRRM2 seen in the Western blots. Thus, we hypothesize that hRRM2 complements p53R2 to form RR holoenzyme and maintain RR activity in PC3 cells after UV treatment. To further confirm this hypothesis, we examined the effect of RRM2 inhibitors on cells exposed to UV. In PC3 cells, hydroxyurea inhibited hRRM2 and resulted in increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. We also examined the effect of UV treatment on the colony-forming ability of cells transfected with hRRM2 as well as p53R2 sense or antisense expression vectors. Expression of antisense hRRM2 in PC3 cells led to decreased hRRM2 expression and resulted in greater sensitivity to UV than observed in wild-type PC3 cells. Taken together, we conclude that UV-induced activation of p53R2 transcription and binding of p53R2 to hRRM1 to form RR holoenzyme are impaired in the p53-mutant cell line PC3.

14588118|t|Minocycline reduces cell death and improves functional recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury in the rat.
14588118|a|We examined the effects of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory drug, on functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats received a mild, weight-drop contusion injury to the spinal cord and were treated with the vehicle or minocycline at a dose of 90 mg/kg immediately after SCI and then twice at a dose of 45 mg/kg every 12 h. Injecting minocycline after SCI improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Twenty four to 38 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in minocycline-treated rats as compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion size increased progressively in both vehicle-treated and minocycline-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with minocycline, the lesion size was significantly reduced at 21-38 days after SCI when compared to the vehicle control. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after SCI as compared to that of the vehicle control. DNA gel electrophoresis also revealed a marked decrease in DNA laddering in response to treatment with minocycline. In addition, minocycline treatment significantly reduced the specific caspase-3 activity after SCI as compared to that of vehicle control. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses revealed that minocycline treatment increased expression of interleukin-10 mRNA but decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. These data suggest that, after SCI, minocycline treatment modulated expression of cytokines, attenuated cell death and the size of lesions, and improved functional recovery in the injured rat. This approach may provide a therapeutic intervention enabling us to reduce cell death and improve functional recovery after SCI.

14602594|t|Innovative approach for improvement of an antibiotic-overproducing industrial strain of Streptomyces albus.
14602594|a|Working with a Streptomyces albus strain that had previously been bred to produce industrial amounts (10 mg/ml) of salinomycin, we demonstrated the efficacy of introducing drug resistance-producing mutations for further strain improvement. Mutants with enhanced salinomycin production were detected at a high incidence (7 to 12%) among spontaneous isolates resistant to streptomycin (Str(r)), gentamicin, or rifampin (Rif(r)). Finally, we successfully demonstrated improvement of the salinomycin productivity of the industrial strain by 2.3-fold by introducing a triple mutation. The Str(r) mutant was shown to have a point mutation within the rpsL gene (encoding ribosomal protein S12). Likewise, the Rif(r) mutant possessed a mutation in the rpoB gene (encoding the RNA polymerase beta subunit). Increased productivity of salinomycin in the Str(r) mutant (containing the K88R mutation in the S12 protein) may be a result of an aberrant protein synthesis mechanism. This aberration may manifest itself as enhanced translation activity in stationary-phase cells, as we have observed with the poly(U)-directed cell-free translation system. The K88R mutant ribosome was characterized by increased 70S complex stability in low Mg(2+) concentrations. We conclude that this aberrant protein synthesis ability in the Str(r) mutant, which is a result of increased stability of the 70S complex, is responsible for the remarkable salinomycin production enhancement obtained.

14619588|t|[The effects of nandrolone phenylpropionate on androgen receptor of liver and sexual glands in burned rats].
14619588|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of nandrolone phenylpropionate (NP) on androgen receptor (AR) of liver and sexual glands in burned rats for supporting the clinical application of anabolic steroids. METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats with a deep second-degree cutaneous burn of 20% total body surface area were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 5 mg/kg NP (NP group) or normal saline as placebo (control group) every other day. The mean integrated optical density (mIOD) of androgen receptor (AR) in liver, testis, ovary tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry ENVISION and LSAB respectively on the 4th, 7th, 14th and 21st days after scalding. RESULTS: The density of AR in liver tissue in NP group was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The density of AR in testis and ovary tissues showed no significant difference between NP group and control group at every time-point (P > 0.05). The side-effect of NP at this dose level on sexual glands seemed limited. CONCLUSION: Nandrolone phenylpropionate up-regulated the density of AR in liver tissue, whereas it had no significant effects on the density of AR in testis and ovary tissues. NP was used with safety at this dose level in rats.

14659797|t|Serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor loss of function mutation in a patient with fenfluramine-associated primary pulmonary hypertension.
14659797|a|OBJECTIVE: Appetite-suppressant drug fenfluramine is implicated in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) but the molecular pathways that mediate this effect are unknown. A mouse model incriminates the serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor but contrasts with other models where this receptor has been shown to mediate pulmonary arterial relaxation via nitric oxide production. METHODS: We analyzed the human 5-HT(2B) gene in 10 patients with appetite-suppressant drug-associated PPH. RESULTS: A mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product was found in one patient. The mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5-HT(2B) mutation was found in 18 PPH patients not associated with appetite-suppressants. Functional analysis of the transfected receptor expressed either transiently in COS cells or stably in CHO cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the second messenger inositol-phosphates cascade and subsequent intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell membrane. The mutated receptor had no constitutive activity, and produced no dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor. CONCLUSION: Loss of serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor function may predispose to fenfluramine-associated PPH in man.

14722255|t|The antileukemia drug 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine: an intrinsic transcriptional antagonist.
14722255|a|The nucleoside analog 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo; cladribine) is effective in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CldAdo is phosphorylated and incorporated into cellular DNA but is not an absolute chain terminator. We demonstrated by in vitro gel-shift assays that binding interactions of the human TATA box-binding protein (TBP) were disrupted on 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine monophosphate (CldAMP)-substituted TATA box consensus sequences. We hypothesized that human RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcriptional processes would therefore be affected by 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (CldATP) incorporation into a promoter TATA element. Double-stranded DNA templates containing the adenovirus major late promoter and coding sequences were enzymatically synthesized as control or with site-specific CldAMP residues, incubated with HeLa extract, and the synthesis of radiolabeled 44-base transcripts was assessed. With increasing amounts of HeLa extract, CldAMP substitution for dAMP within the TATA box decreased in vitro pol II transcription by approximately 35% compared with control substrates. Time-course studies showed that transcript production increased in a linear fashion on control substrates. In contrast, transcription on CldAMP-substituted TATA sequences reached a plateau after 20 min. Furthermore, CldAMP-substituted promoter sequences trapped or sequestered TBP, preventing its dissociation from DNA and subsequent binding to additional TATA elements to reinitiate transcription. CldAdo thus represents the first example of a nucleoside analog that acts as a transcriptional antagonist. CldATP incorporation into gene regulatory sequences may provide a novel strategy to modulate specific protein/DNA interactions.

14757145|t|Blockade of beta 1- and desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptors reduce isoprenaline-induced cardiac fibrosis.
14757145|a|The aim of the present study was to analyse the role of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the catecholamine-induced myocardial remodeling, especially the interstitial fibrosis. Wistar rats were subjected to a 2-week chronic isoprenaline administration (30 microg/kg/h). Rats received a concomitant treatment with the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) or were chronically pretreated with the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (40 microg/kg/h) for 1 week to induce beta(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization. The pretreatment with salbutamol induced a 59% down-regulation of left ventricular beta(2)-adrenoceptors compared to control. The extent of the isoprenaline-induced left ventricular fibrosis was significantly reduced in both the bisoprolol and salbutamol groups compared with the control isoprenaline-treated group especially in the apical region (1.7+/-0.6% and 1.4+/-0.3% versus 6.0+/-1.3%, respectively, P<0.005). beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockade and beta(2)-adrenoceptors down-regulation provided similar protection against isoprenaline-induced cardiac interstitial fibrosis suggesting that both beta-adrenoceptors are involved in such cardiac remodeling process.

14757700|t|Characterization of the mouse cold-menthol receptor TRPM8 and vanilloid receptor type-1 VR1 using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay.
14757700|a|1. TRPM8 (CMR1) is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel, which can be activated by low temperatures, menthol, eucalyptol and icilin. It belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, and therefore is related to vanilloid receptor type-1 (VR1, TRPV1). We tested whether substances which are structurally related to menthol, or which produce a cooling sensation, could activate TRPM8, and compared the responses of TRPM8 and VR1 to these ligands. 2. The effects of 70 odorants and menthol-related substances on recombinant mouse TRPM8 (mTRPM8), expressed in HEK293 cells, were examined using a FLIPR assay. In all, 10 substances (linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, WS-3, WS-23, FrescolatMGA, FrescolatML, PMD38, CoolactP and Cooling Agent 10) were found to be agonists. 3. The EC(50) values of the agonists defined their relative potencies: icilin (0.2+/-0.1 microM)>FrescolatML (3.3+/-1.5 microM) > WS-3 (3.7+/-1.7 microM) >(-)menthol (4.1+/-1.3 microM) >frescolatMAG (4.8+/-1.1 microM) > cooling agent 10 (6+/-2.2 microM) >(+)menthol (14.4+/-1.3 microM) > PMD38 (31+/-1.1 microM) > WS-23 (44+/-7.3 microM) > Coolact P (66+/-20 microM) > geraniol (5.9+/-1.6 mM) > linalool (6.7+/-2.0 mM) > eucalyptol (7.7+/-2.0 mM) > hydroxycitronellal (19.6+/-2.2 mM). 4. Known VR1 antagonists (BCTC, thio-BCTC and capsazepine) were also able to block the response of TRPM8 to menthol (IC(50): 0.8+/-1.0, 3.5+/-1.1 and 18+/-1.1 microM, respectively). 5. The Ca(2+) response of hVR1-transfected HEK293 cells to the endogenous VR1 agonist N-arachidonoyl-dopamine was potentiated by low pH. In contrast, menthol- and icilin-activated TRPM8 currents were suppressed by low pH. 6. In conclusion, in the present study, we identified 10 new agonists and three antagonists of TRPM8. We found that, in contrast to VR1, TRPM8 is inhibited rather than potentiated by protons.

15049511|t|Inhibitory effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
15049511|a|1. The inhibitory effects of tranylcypromine, a nonselective irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), on three cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, namely CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, have been evaluated in vitro. 2. The studies were conducted using cDNA-expressed human CYP enzymes and probe substrates. 3. A range of substrate concentrations was coincubated with a range of tranylcypromine concentrations in the presence of each of the CYP enzymes at 37 degrees C for a predetermined period of time. Product concentrations were quantified by HPLC with UV detection. 4. The results demonstrated that tranylcypromine is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C19 (Ki = 32 microM) and CYP2D6 (Ki = 367 microM) and a noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 (Ki = 56 microM). 5. None of these inhibitory effects are considered clinically significant at usual therapeutic doses. However, in certain situations such as high dose tranylcypromine therapy, or in poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 substrates, clinically significant interactions might occur, particularly when tranylcypromine is coadministered with drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

15058382|t|Organization and expression of the SLC36 cluster of amino acid transporter genes.
15058382|a|Three closely related genes encoding amino acid transport proteins are clustered on 5q32 in humans, and Chromosome (Chr) 11 in mice. The human SLC36A1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal amino acid transporter LYAAT1/PAT1, generates multiple alternative mRNAs, some of which encode truncated proteins. SLC36A1 is expressed in numerous tissues, whereas expression of SLC36A2, which encodes the glycine transporter tramdorinl/PAT2, is most abundant in kidney and muscle. Expression of a third gene, SLC36A3, is restricted to testis. Mouse Slc36a2 also is expressed in bone and fat tissue. Polymorphisms in human SLC36A2 exclude it as a candidate locus for a peripheral neuropathy that has been mapped to 5q31-33. SLC36A2 is a candidate gene for 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, on the basis of its chromosomal location and its expression in bone.

15075397|t|ATR regulates a G2-phase cell-cycle checkpoint in Arabidopsis thaliana.
15075397|a|Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation, transmitting DNA damage signals to downstream effectors of cell-cycle progression. In animals, ATR is an essential gene. Here, we find that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atr-/- mutants were viable, fertile, and phenotypically wild-type in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging agents but exhibit altered expression of AtRNR1 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit) and alteration of some damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints. atr mutants were hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, and UV-B light but only mildly sensitive to gamma-radiation. G2 arrest was observed in response to gamma-irradiation in both wild-type and atr plants, albeit with slightly different kinetics, suggesting that ATR plays a secondary role in response to double-strand breaks. G2 arrest also was observed in wild-type plants in response to aphidicolin but was defective in atr mutants, resulting in compaction of nuclei and subsequent cell death. By contrast, HU-treated wild-type and atr plants arrested in G1 and showed no obvious signs of cell death. We propose that, in plants, HU invokes a novel checkpoint responsive to low levels of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. These results demonstrate the important role of cell-cycle checkpoints in the ability of plant cells to sense and cope with problems associated with DNA replication.

15109613|t|Selective activation of thyroid hormone signaling pathways by GC-1: a new approach to controlling cholesterol and body weight.
15109613|a|The current report describes progress in development of a selective thyroid hormone receptor modulator, GC-1. This compound binds selectively to the beta-isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor, and its uptake into the heart is relatively low. Studies in rats, mice and monkeys show that GC-1 lowers cholesterol with 600- to 1400-fold more potency and approximately two- to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin, a compound that blocks HMG-CoA reductase. GC-1 also decreases plasma levels of triglyceride and lipoprotein (a), and induces loss of fat. These effects can be observed under conditions where there is either no or minimal effect on heart rate, and no detectable loss of muscle.

15180525|t|Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase as a drug target in leukemia.
15180525|a|The hematopoietic class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Flt3 (Flk2, STK1) has recently received much attention as a potential drug target. Activation of Flt3 by different types of mutations plays an important role for proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and prevention of differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At least one type of such mutations - an internal tandem duplication in the Flt3 juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) - has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Signal transduction of Flt3 involves activation of several conserved pathways, including the RAS/MAP-Kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades. Transforming versions of Flt3 exhibit altered signaling, for example a very pronounced activation of STAT5, ultimately resulting in alternate profiles of gene expression and cell transformation. Selective inhibitors of Flt3 tyrosine kinase activity have the potential to suppress aberrant Flt3 signaling. Although highly homologous to other class III RTKs, Flt3 is resistant to the phenylaminopyrimidine STI571 (Gleevec, Imatinib), a potent inhibitor of other RTKs in the family, such as the PDGFbeta-receptor or c-Kit. STI571 binding to Flt3 is prevented by the phenylalanine 691 side-chain in the ATP binding center and mutating this site to threonine renders the corresponding Flt3 mutant sensitive to STI571. Compounds of several other structural families, including the quinoxaline AG1296, the bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanone D-65476, the indolinones SU5416 and SU11248, the indolocarbazoles PKC412 and CEP-701, and the piperazonyl quinazoline CT53518, are potent inhibitors of Flt3 kinase. They exhibit different selectivity profiles, both with respect to other kinases and among wildtype Flt3 and its activated versions. These compounds hold promise as novel drugs against AML and as probes for understanding activation mechanisms and signaling pathways in the class III RTK family.

15192023|t|Novel mechanism of action for hydralazine: induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenesis by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases.
15192023|a|The vasodilator hydralazine, used clinically in cardiovascular therapy, relaxes arterial smooth muscle by inhibiting accumulation of intracellular free Ca2+ via an unidentified primary target. Collagen prolyl hydroxylase is a known target of hydralazine. We therefore investigated whether inhibition of other members of this enzyme family, namely the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-regulating O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, could represent a novel mechanism of action. Hydralazine induced rapid and transient expression of HIF-1alpha and downstream targets of HIF (endothelin-1, adrenomedullin, haem oxygenase 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and induced endothelial cell-specific proliferation. Hydralazine dose-dependently inhibited PHD activity and induced nonhydroxylated HIF-1alpha, evidence for HIF stabilization specifically by inhibition of PHD enzyme activity. In vivo, hydralazine induced HIF-1alpha and VEGF protein in tissue extracts and elevated plasma VEGF levels. In sponge angiogenesis assays, hydralazine increased stromal cell infiltration and blood vessel density versus control animals. Thus, hydralazine activates the HIF pathway through inhibition of PHD activity and initiates a pro-angiogenic phenotype. This represents a novel mechanism of action for hydralazine and presents HIF as a potential target for treatment of ischemic disease.

15198222|t|Determination of expression of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 isozymes in canine tissues and their differential sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
15198222|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cyclooxygenase isozyme distribution in tissues from dogs and determine the differential sensitivity of canine cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 isozymes to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). SAMPLE POPULATION: Canine tissue samples (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon, spleen, cerebral cortex, lung, ovary, kidney, and liver) were obtained from 2 dogs for northern and western blot analyses, and blood for whole blood COX assays was obtained from 15 dogs. PROCEDURE: 11 NSAIDs were evaluated to determine their COX-2 selectivity in whole blood assays. The concentrations of the drug needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity (IC50) were then calculated for comparison. Expression and tissue distribution of COX isozymes were determined by northern and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamic acid, and piroxicam had little selectivity toward COX isozymes, whereas NS398, carprofen, tolfenamic acid, nimesulide, and etodolac had more than 5 times greater preference for inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1. All canine tissues examined, including those from the gastrointestinal tract, coexpressed COX-1 and -2 mRNA, although protein expression was observed only for COX-1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Canine COX-2 was selectively inhibited by etodolac, nimesulide, and NS398; tolfenamic acid and carprofen also appeared to be preferential COX-2 inhibitors in dogs. The roles of COX-1 as a constitutive housekeeping enzyme and COX-2 as a proinflammatory inducible enzyme (as determined in humans) appear to apply to dogs; therefore, COX-2-selective inhibitors should prove useful in reducing the adverse effects associated with nonselective NSAIDs.

1526623|t|Ketoconazole binds to the human androgen receptor.
1526623|a|Ketoconazole, an imidazole anti-fungal agent, has often produced features of androgen deficiency including decreased libido, gynecomastia, impotence, oligospermia, and decreased testosterone levels, in men being treated for chronic mycotic infections. Based on these potent effects on gonadal function in vivo as well as previous work in vitro demonstrating affinity of ketoconazole for receptor proteins for glucocorticoids and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and for sex steroid binding globulin (SSBG), the binding of ketoconazole to human androgen receptors (AR) in vitro was also examined. Ketoconazole competition with [3H]methyltrienolone (R1881) for androgen binding sites in dispersed, intact cultured human skin fibroblasts was determined at 22 degrees C. Fifty percent displacement of [3H]R1881 binding to AR was achieved by 6.4 +/- 1.8 (SE) x 10(-5) M ketoconazole. Additional binding studies performed with ketoconazole in the presence of increasing amounts of [3H]R1881 showed that the interaction of ketoconazole with AR was competitive when the data were analyzed by the Scatchard method. It should be noted, however, that the dose of ketoconazole required for 50% occupancy of the androgen receptor is not likely to be achieved in vivo, at least in plasma. Finally, androgen binding studies performed with other imidazoles, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and fluconozole, revealed that in this class of compounds only ketoconazole appears to interact with the androgen receptor. Ketoconazole appears to be the first example of a non-steroidal compound which binds competitively to both SSBG and multiple steroid hormone receptors, suggesting that the ligand binding sites of these proteins share some features in common.

15291969|t|P2 receptor mRNA expression profiles in human lymphocytes, monocytes and CD34+ stem and progenitor cells.
15291969|a|BACKGROUND: Extracellular nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP and UDP) exert a wide range of biological effects in blood cells mediated by multiple ionotropic P2X receptors and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors. Although pharmacological experiments have suggested the presence of several P2 receptor subtypes on monocytes and lymphocytes, some results are contradictory. Few physiological functions have been firmly established to a specific receptor subtype, partly because of a lack of truly selective agonists and antagonists. This stimulated us to investigate the expression of P2X and P2Y receptors in human lymphocytes and monocytes with a newly established quantitative mRNA assay for P2 receptors. In addition, we describe for the first time the expression of P2 receptors in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells implicating a potential role of P2 receptors in hematopoietic lineage and progenitor/stem cell function. RESULTS: Using a quantitative mRNA assay, we assessed the hypothesis that there are specific P2 receptor profiles in inflammatory cells. The P2X4 receptor had the highest expression in lymphocytes and monocytes. Among the P2Y receptors, P2Y12 and P2Y2 had highest expression in lymphocytes, while the P2Y2 and P2Y13 had highest expression in monocytes. Several P2 receptors were expressed (P2Y2, P2Y1, P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y11, P2X1, P2X4) in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The most interesting findings were the high mRNA expression of P2Y12 receptors in lymphocytes potentially explaining the anti-inflammatory effects of clopidogrel, P2Y13 receptors in monocytes and a previously unrecognised expression of P2X4 in lymphocytes and monocytes. In addition, for the first time P2 receptor mRNA expression patterns was studied in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells. Several P2 receptors were expressed (P2Y2, P2Y1, P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y11, P2X1, P2X4), indicating a role in differentiation and proliferation. Thus, it is possible that specific antibodies to P2 receptors could be used to identify progenitors for monocytes, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes.

15292070|t|Direct multiplex assay of lysosomal enzymes in dried blood spots for newborn screening.
15292070|a|BACKGROUND: Newborn screening for deficiency in the lysosomal enzymes that cause Fabry, Gaucher, Krabbe, Niemann-Pick A/B, and Pompe diseases is warranted because treatment for these syndromes is now available or anticipated in the near feature. We describe a multiplex screening method for all five lysosomal enzymes that uses newborn-screening cards containing dried blood spots as the enzyme source. METHODS: We used a cassette of substrates and internal standards to directly quantify the enzymatic activities, and tandem mass spectrometry for enzymatic product detection. Rehydrated dried blood spots were incubated with the enzyme substrates. We used liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase extraction with silica gel to remove buffer components. Acarbose served as inhibitor of an interfering acid alpha-glucosidase present in neutrophils, which allowed the lysosomal enzyme implicated in Pompe disease to be selectively analyzed. RESULTS: We analyzed dried blood spots from 5 patients with Gaucher, 5 with Niemann-Pick A/B, 11 with Pompe, 5 with Fabry, and 12 with Krabbe disease, and in all cases the enzyme activities were below the minimum activities measured in a collection of heterozygous carriers and healthy noncarrier individuals. The enzyme activities measured in 5-9 heterozygous carriers were approximately one-half those measured with 15-32 healthy individuals, but there was partial overlap of each condition between the data sets for carriers and healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: For all five diseases, the affected individuals were detected. The assay can be readily automated, and the anticipated reagent and supply costs are well within the budget limits of newborn-screening centers.

15299009|t|A disorder to order transition accompanies catalysis in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II.
15299009|a|Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II (RalDH2) converts retinal to the transcriptional regulator retinoic acid in the developing embryo. The x-ray structure of the enzyme revealed an important structural difference between this protein and other aldehyde dehydrogenases of the same enzyme superfamily; a 20-amino acid span in the substrate access channel in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II is disordered, whereas in other aldehyde dehydrogenases this region forms a well defined wall of the substrate access channel. We asked whether this disordered loop might order during the course of catalysis and provide a means for an enzyme that requires a large substrate access channel to restrict access to the catalytic machinery by smaller compounds that might potentially enter the active site and be metabolized. Our experiments, a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques, suggest that a disorder to order transition is linked to catalytic activity.

15325927|a|Although the benefits of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and depressed ejection fraction (EF) have been elucidated, those in patients with preserved EF are not understood. We enrolled 40 patients with mild or moderate heart failure and EF >/=45%. They were randomly assigned to carvedilol (n = 19) or conventional therapy (n = 21). After 12 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly improved all end points (plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] from 175 (35 to 209) to 106 (52 to 160) pg/ml, mean (95% confidence interval) p <0.01; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.37 (2.13 to 2.61) to 1.56 (1.21 to 1.91), p <0.01; exercise capacity estimated with the Specific Activity Scale from 4.75 (4.50 to 5.00) to 5.68 (5.22 to 6.14) METs, p <0.02), whereas conventional therapy did not (plasma BNP concentration from 150 (114 to 186) to 174 (100 to 248) pg/ml; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.29 (2.08 to 2.50) to 2.11 (1.73 to 2.49); exercise capacity from 4.57 (4.34 to 4.80) to 4.72 (4.41 to 5.03) METs). Univariate regression analyses showed that only the use of carvedilol was correlated with the decrease in plasma BNP concentration (p <0.03). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that an ischemic cause of heart failure (p <0.02), high plasma concentration of BNP (p <0.02), left ventricular dilation (p <0.03), and use of carvedilol (p <0.04) at baseline were predictive of a decrease in plasma concentration of BNP. In conclusion, carvedilol potentially decreased neurohumoral activation, decreased symptoms, and increased exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and preserved EF.

1543672|t|Terbinafine: mode of action and properties of the squalene epoxidase inhibition.
1543672|a|Terbinafine (Lamisil) has primarily fungicidal action against many fungi as a result of its specific mechanism of squalene epoxidase inhibition. Treated fungi accumulate squalene while becoming deficient in ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The cidal action is closely associated with the development of high intracellular squalene concentrations, which are believed to interfere with fungal membrane function and cell wall synthesis. In the case of Candida albicans, growth inhibition with terbinafine appears to result from the ergosterol deficiency. The filamentous form of this fungus is more susceptible than the yeast form. Measurement of ergosterol biosynthesis by incorporation of radiolabelled precursors indicates a correlation between inhibition of growth and ergosterol biosynthesis in a range of pathogenic fungi. Terbinafine is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase from Candida (Ki = 30 nM). In contrast, inhibition of rat liver squalene epoxidase only occurs at higher drug concentrations (Ki = 77 microM), and is competitive with squalene. Thus, terbinafine has no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. Squalene epoxidase is not an enzyme of the cytochrome P-450 type, thereby avoiding potential inhibition of this class of enzymes.

15446566|t|[A case report of metastatic pancreatic cancer that responded remarkably to the combination of thalidomide, celecoxib and irinotecan].
15446566|a|The prognosis of pancreatic cancer with metastases or recurrence is quite poor. Chemotherapy has not resulted in a significant survival benefit; median survival is 3-6 months. Various chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated and the standard chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine. The response rate, however, is low at 13%. Thalidomide and celecoxib have different mechanisms of action and activity in various malignant tumors. Both have been evaluated and shown to demonstrate activity against solid tumors. Thalidomide decreased the stability of TNF-mRNA and COX-2 mRNA. COX-2 is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. Although celecoxib inhibits PG biosynthesis, most do not affect the peroxidase activity of COX, which can generate proximate carcinogens. Because thalidomide does not completely inhibit COX-2 expression or PG biosynthesis, a therapeutic strategy combining celecoxib with thalidomide might be more effective than using either agent alone. Differences in the mechanism of action of gemcitabine and irinotecan suggest that a change of gemcitabine to irinotecan could provide clinically efficacious outcomes. In order to accomplish new treatment strategies, we have been using thalidomide, celecoxib and irinotecan in low-doses. We believe this combination represents a viable treatment for patients of pancreatic cancer with recurrence or metastases.

15474503|t|Effect of pitavastatin on apolipoprotein A-I production in HepG2 cell.
15474503|a|There are few reports describing the mechanism of HDL-elevating action of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). As it is considered that the key step of HDL production is the secretion of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), we investigated the effect of statins on apoA-I synthesis and secretion by HepG2 cell to elucidate the mechanism of the action. Each statin induced apoA-I expression (mRNA and protein) dose-dependently: the rank order of the apoA-I induction pitavastatin (3 microM)>simvastatin (10 microM)>atorvastatin (30 microM). The induction of apoA-I by statins disappeared with addition of mevalonate, which indicates that the effect is HMG-CoA reductase inhibition-dependent. Based on HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, pitavastatin-induced apoA-I more efficiently than simvastatin and atorvastatin. Further study revealed that pitavastatin increased ABCA1 mRNA in HMG-CoA reductase-dependent manner and that Rho and Rho kinase inhibitor (C3T and Y27632) increased apoA-I production in the HepG2 cells. These results suggest that pitavastatin efficiently increases apoA-I in the culture medium of HepG2 cells by promoting apoA-I production through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and suppression of Rho activity and by protecting apoA-I from catabolism through ABCA1 induction and lipidation of apoA-I.

15557593|t|A multitargeted, metronomic, and maximum-tolerated dose "chemo-switch" regimen is antiangiogenic, producing objective responses and survival benefit in a mouse model of cancer.
15557593|a|PURPOSE: A transgenic mouse model has revealed parameters of the angiogenic switch during multistep tumorigenesis of pancreatic islets, and demonstrated efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies. Pericytes have been revealed as functionally important for tumor neovasculature, using kinase inhibitors targeting their platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors and metronomic chemotherapy show modest benefit against early- but not late-stage disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seeking to improve efficacy against otherwise intractable end-stage pancreatic islet tumors, two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and SU11248, were used to disrupt PDGFR-mediated pericyte support of tumor endothelial cells in concert with maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or metronomic chemotherapy and/or VEGFR inhibition. RESULTS: Imatinib, despite equivocal efficacy as monotherapy, reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and enhanced efficacy in combination with metronomic chemotherapy or VEGFR inhibition. A regimen involving all three was even better. MTD using cyclophosphamide caused transitory regression, but then rapid regrowth, in contrast to metronomic cyclophosphamide plus imatinib, which produced stable disease. The MTD regimen elicited apoptosis of tumor cells but not endothelial cells, whereas the other regimens increased endothelial cell apoptosis concordant with efficacy. A "chemo-switch" protocol, involving sequential MTD and then metronomic chemotherapy, overlaid with multitargeted inhibition of PDGFR and VEGFR, gave complete responses and unprecedented survival advantage in this model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a potentially tractable clinical strategy in a stringent preclinical model, wherein standard-of-care chemotherapy is followed by a novel maintenance regimen: PDFGR is targeted to disrupt pericyte support, while metronomic chemotherapy and/or VEGFR inhibitors target consequently sensitized endothelial cells, collectively destabilizing pre-existing tumor vasculature and inhibiting ongoing angiogenesis.

15563928|t|Preferential and non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduce inflammation during lipopolysaccharide-induced synovitis.
15563928|a|Synovitis in horses is frequently treated by administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). Constitutively expressed COX-1 is involved in physiologic functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, whereas COX-2 is up-regulated at sites of inflammation. Thus, COX-2 inhibitors reduce inflammation with reduced gastrointestinal side effects as compared to non-selective COX inhibitors. The objective of the present study was to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of the preferential COX-2 inhibitor etodolac with the non-selective COX inhibitor phenylbutazone in horses with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synovitis. Three groups of horses (n=6) received no treatment, phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg, IV, q12h), or etodolac (23 mg/kg, IV, q12h), respectively, 2-h following injection of LPS into one middle carpal joint. Synovial fluid was analyzed for white blood cell (WBC) count, and TXB2 and PGE2 levels. Phenylbutazone and etodolac significantly reduced WBC count 6 and 24-h following injection of LPS compared to untreated horses. In addition, both drugs significantly reduced PGE2 levels (P<0.05) 6-h following LPS injection, whereas the probable COX-1 prostanoid TXB2 was significantly reduced by phenylbutazone (P<0.05), but not etodolac. Etodolac may serve as a more selective anti-inflammatory agent than phenylbutazone for treatment of equine synovitis.

15612980|t|Genetic polymorphisms predisposing to hyperhomocysteinemia in cardiac transplant patients.
15612980|a|Genetic determinants for high homocysteine (Hcy) levels are now well known. We studied several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in Hcy-regulating genes [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C; methionine synthase (MS) A2756G; methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G] in relation to total plasma Hcy levels, transplant coronary artery disease and thromboembolic episodes in 84 heart transplant patients, and we compared the incidence of these polymorphisms with those in a healthy adult controls. At least one copy of the G allele of the MTRR A66G SNP was found in a significantly greater proportion of cardiac transplant (CTX) recipients compared with controls (94.0% vs. 79.9% respectively). None of the SNP analyzed were correlated with total Hcy plasma levels or the presence of transplant coronary artery disease. However, MS A2756G was significantly associated with cobalamin levels (AA genotype: 290 +/- 122 pmol/l; AG: 381 +/- 151 pmol/l and GG: 415 +/- 100 pmol/l), as was MTRR A66G (AA: 478 +/- 219 pmol/l, AG: 306 +/- 124 pmol/l and GG: 306 +/- 123 pmol/l). MTRR A66G was also correlated with serum folate. No association was found with thromboembolic events. In conclusion, there was a significant difference in the frequency of the G allele genotype of the MTRR A66G in CTX patients versus controls. Differences in cobalamin and folate levels with the MTRR A66G and MS A2756G polymorphisms were noted. Thus, SNP in Hcy-regulating genes may be important determinants of vitamin metabolism in CTX, raising the question of increased vitamin requirements to minimize increased plasma Hcy in this high-risk group.

15629255|t|Effect of bosentan (ETA/ETB receptor antagonist) on metabolic changes during stress and diabetes.
15629255|a|Elevated plasma ET-1 levels have been reported in several conditions such as stress and diabetes. ET-1 is found to cause insulin resistance and to stimulate liver glycogenolysis. The question arises whether ET-1 has a role in the metabolic changes occurring in such conditions. To test this, we studied the possible effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) on serum glucose and insulin levels as well as on liver glycogen contents in normoglycemic stressed animals. In addition, the effect of bosentan on serum glucose and insulin levels in both mild and severely diabetic rats and its effect on insulin-induced hypoglycemia were also determined. Restraining water immersion stress was used as a model for severe stress reported to elevate plasma ET-1 level. Mild diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (38 mg kg(-1)) while severe diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a higher dose of streptozotocin (45 mg kg(-1)). Bosentan partially prevented stress-induced both hyperglycemia and decrease in glycogen content while it completely blocked the stress-induced decrease in insulin level in normoglycemic stressed rats. Bosentan also decreased serum glucose level without any effect on insulin secretion in mild diabetic rats and potentiated the hypoglycemic action of insulin.

15646028|t|Modification of radiation damage to mitochondrial system in vivo by Podophyllum hexandrum: mechanistic aspects.
15646028|a|The present study was undertaken to investigate whether RP-1 treatment protected mitochondrial system against radiation damage and also to unravel the mechanism associated with this process. Radioprotection of mitochondrial system by Podophyllum hexandrum (RP-1) was investigated to understand its mechanism of action. Levels of superoxide anion (O2-), reduced or oxidized glutathione (GSH or GSSG), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), protein carbonyl (PC), ATP, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex-I), NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex I/II), succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II/III) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were studied in mitochondria isolated from liver of mice belonging to various treatment groups. Whole body y-irradiation (10 Gy) significantly (p < 0.01) increased the formation of O2-, PC, and TBARS, upto 24 h as compared to untreated control. RP-1 treatment (200 mg/kg b.w.) to mice 2 h before irradiation reduced the radiation-induced O2- generation within 4 h and formation of TBARS and PC upto 24 h significantly (p < 0.01). Singularly irradiation or RP-1 treatment significantly (p < 0.01) increased the levels of glutathione within an hour, as compared to untreated control. Pre-irradiation administration of RP-1 enhanced levels of GSH induced increase in complex I (upto 16 h), complex I/III (4 h) complex II/III activity (upto 24 h; p < 0.01) and inhibited the radiation-induced decrease in MMP significantly (24 h; p < 0.01). The present study indicates that RP-1 itself modulates several mitichondrial perameters due to its influence on the biochemical milieu within and outside the cells. However, RP-1 treatment before irradiation modulates radiation induced perturbations such as the increase in electron transport chain enzyme activity, formation of O2-, TBARS and PC to offer radioprotection.

15665864|t|Effects of minocycline on Fas-mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice.
15665864|a|1. Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on cartilage, neurons and periodontal tissues, and both properties are central to the pharmaceutical treatment of liver diseases. We investigated the effects of minocycline on fulminant hepatitis in C57BL/6J mice induced by lethal challenge of the activating anti-Fas antibody, Jo2. 2. Intraperitoneal injection of Jo2 (0.6 microg g(-1)) to mice resulted in fulminant hepatitis, as evidenced by increase of serum alanine/aspartate transaminase activities and histopathological alterations in liver sections, as well as animal death. Nevertheless, mice pretreated with three doses of minocycline (5 mg kg(-1)) resisted this lethal effect significantly. Minocycline treatment improved the survival kinetics, although to a lesser extent, when mice were challenged simultaneously with Jo2 or even treated 30 min after the lethal challenge. 3. Jo2-induced activation of caspase-3 or -9 in liver tissues was inhibited by minocycline pretreatment, and yet the direct addition of minocycline to liver extracts from Jo2-challenged mice failed to block caspase activation in vitro. Moreover, minocycline efficiently suppressed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria of the liver tissues from Jo2-challenged mice. In contrast, caspase-8 activation and Bid truncation triggered by Jo2 were not diminished by minocycline pretreatment in mouse livers. 4. Our results suggest that easing of Fas-triggered fulminant hepatitis by minocycline may involve a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, probably through preventing cytochrome c release and thereby blocking downstream caspase activation.

15671155|t|Role of hydrogen sulfide in acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury.
15671155|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a naturally occurring gas with potent vasodilator activity. Cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) utilize L-cysteine as substrate to form H2S. Of these two enzymes, cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) is believed to be the key enzyme that forms H2S in the cardiovascular system. Whilst H2S has been reported to relax precontracted rat arteries in vitro and to lower blood pressure in the rat, its effect in an inflammatory condition such as acute pancreatitis has not previously been reported. In this paper, we report the presence of H2S synthesizing enzyme activity and CSE (as determined by mRNA signal) in the pancreas. Also, prophylactic, as well as therapeutic, treatment with the CSE inhibitor, DL-propargylglycine (PAG), significantly reduced the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatitis and associated lung injury, as determined by 1) hyperamylasemia [plasma amylase (U/L) (control, 1204+/-59); prophylactic treatment: placebo, 10635+/-305; PAG, 7904+/-495; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 10427+/-470; PAG, 7811+/-428; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group]; 2) neutrophil sequestration in the pancreas [pancreatic myeloperoxidase oxidase (MPO) activity (fold increase over control) (prophylactic treatment: placebo, 5.78+/-0.63; PAG, 2.97+/-0.39; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 5.48+/-0.52; PAG, 3.03+/-0.47; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group)]; 3) pancreatic acinar cell injury/necrosis; 4) lung MPO activity (fold increase over control) [prophylactic treatment: placebo, 1.99+/-0.16; PAG, 1.34+/-0.14; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 2.03+/-0.12; PAG, 1.41+/-0.97; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group]; and 5) histological evidence of lung injury. These effects of CSE blockade suggest an important proinflammatory role of H2S in regulating the severity of pancreatitis and associated lung injury and raise the possibility that H2S may exert similar activity in other forms of inflammation.

15694653|t|Atypical and typical antipsychotic drug interactions with the dopamine D2 receptor.
15694653|a|A model of the dopamine D2 receptor was used to study the receptor interactions of dopamine, the typical antipsychotics haloperidol and loxapine, and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and melperone. The atypical antipsychotics interacted with the halogen atom of the ring system in the direction of the transmembrane helices (TMHs) 2, 3 and 7, while the typical had the corresponding halogen atom in the direction of TMH5. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the average helical displacement upon binding increased in the order: typical < atypical < dopamine. Upon binding, the atypical induced larger displacements into TMH5 than did the typical. The typical had stronger non-bonded interactions with the receptor than had the atypical, which is in agreement with the experimental observation that the atypical antipsychotic drugs dissociate faster from the receptor than the typical antipsychotic drugs.

15700891|t|Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15700891|a|PURPOSE: The pharmacology and tolerability of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied. METHODS: Two randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Treatment with oral antidiabetic agents was stopped 14 days before study initiation. In the first study (study A), eight subjects received placebo, 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and either 0.4-microg/kg exenatide or placebo five minutes before a meal combined with liquid acetaminophen (to assess the rate of gastric emptying) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. In the second study (study B), subjects received a single s.c. dose of exenatide or placebo on consecutive days. Part 1 of study B used exenatide doses of 0.01 and 0.1 microg/ kg; 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1-microg/kg doses were given in part 2. After an overnight fast, the study drug was injected 15 minutes before a meal (part 1) and before a meal and acetaminophen (part 2). Parts 1 and 2 of study B enrolled six and eight patients, respectively. RESULTS: In both studies, plasma exenatide pharmacokinetic profiles appeared dose proportional. Exenatide doses of 0.02-0.2 microg/kg dose-dependently lowered postprandial glucose excursions. Exenatide suppressed postprandial plasma glucagon and slowed gastric emptying. There were no serious adverse events and no patient withdrawals related to treatment. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events and were mild to moderate in severity at doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 microg/kg. CONCLUSION: Administration of preprandial exenatide by s.c. injection resulted in dose-proportional exenatide pharmacokinetics and antidiabetic pharmacodynamic activity. At doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 microg/kg, exenatide dose-dependently reduced postprandial plasma glucose excursion by insulinotropism, suppression of plasma glucagon, and slowing of gastric emptying.

15737409|t|Sterol transporters: targets of natural sterols and new lipid lowering drugs.
15737409|a|Recent insights in the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, the discovery of ezetimibe, the first approved direct cholesterol absorption inhibitor, as well as the identification of Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein as sterol transporter in the gut, focused attention on sterol transport processes in the small intestine and the liver. The identification of defective structures in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 transporters in patients with the rare disease of sitosterolemia elucidated their role as sterol efflux pumps regulating at least in parts the intestinal sterol absorption and the hepatic sterol output. ABCG5 and ABCG8 themselves are regulated by cholesterol via liver X receptors (LXRs), which are also activated by oxysterols and some derivatives of plant sterols. NPC1L1 could recently be identified as a major sterol transporter for the intestinal uptake of cholesterol as well as plant sterols. Studies in NPC1L1 knockout mice indicate that this transporter is essential for the intestinal uptake of sterols and that NPC1L1 might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe. However, studies with photoreactive cholesterol as well as with photoreactive ezetimibe analogues suggest that other processes might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe.

15787205|t|[Change of dopamine transporter activity (DAT) during the action of bupropion (in depression)].
15787205|a|Bupropion has an antidepressant effect through blocking the dopamine transporter. By 99mTc-TRODAT-SPECT, we measured the baseline DAT activity of depressed patients. After 3 weeks' bupropion treatment we studied the change in DAT activity, which corresponds to the occupancy of bupropion. The average occupancy of bupropion on DAT was similar to the international findings at 20.84% in 9 depressed patients.

15811959|t|A phase-1 trial of bexarotene and denileukin diftitox in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
15811959|a|Denileukin diftitox, a genetically engineered fusion protein combining the enzymatically active domains of diphtheria toxin and the full-length sequence for interleukin-2 (IL-2), efficiently targets lymphoma cells expressing the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) consisting of the alpha/p55/CD25, beta/p75/CD122, and gamma/p64/CD132 chains. In vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid X receptor (RXR) retinoid, bexarotene, at biologically relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M, upregulated both the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2R and enhanced 5- to 10-fold the susceptibility of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox. To determine whether this biomodulatory effect could be recapitulated in vivo, we treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of bexarotene (75 mg/day-300 mg/day) and denileukin diftitox (18 mcg/kg per day x 3 days every 21 days) in a phase 1 trial. Overall response was 67% (4 complete responses, 4 partial responses). Modulation of IL-2R expression was observed at or above a bexarotene dose of 150 mg/day. Four patients experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia, and 2 had grade 4 lymphopenia. Our results demonstrate that the combination of denileukin diftitox and bexarotene is well tolerated and that even low doses (150 mg/day) of bexarotene are capable of in vivo upregulation of CD25 expression on circulating leukemia cells.

15837926|t|Crystal structure of prostate-specific membrane antigen, a tumor marker and peptidase.
15837926|a|Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.

15840827|t|Conversion of 5-aminolevulinate synthase into a more active enzyme by linking the two subunits: spectroscopic and kinetic properties.
15840827|a|The two active sites of dimeric 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, are located on the subunit interface with contribution of essential amino acids from each subunit. Linking the two subunits into a single polypeptide chain dimer (2XALAS) yielded an enzyme with an approximate sevenfold greater turnover number than that of wild-type ALAS. Spectroscopic and kinetic properties of 2XALAS were investigated to explore the differences in the coenzyme structure and kinetic mechanism relative to those of wild-type ALAS that confer a more active enzyme. The absorption spectra of both ALAS and 2XALAS had maxima at 410 and 330 nm, with a greater A(410)/A(330) ratio at pH approximately 7.5 for 2XALAS. The 330 nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence at 385 nm but not at 510 nm, indicating that the 330 nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than the enolimine form of the Schiff base. The 385 nm emission intensity increased with increasing pH with a single pK of approximately 8.5 for both enzymes, and thus the 410 and 330 nm absorption species were attributed to the ketoenamine and substituted aldamine, respectively. Transient kinetic analysis of the formation and decay of the quinonoid intermediate EQ(2) indicated that, although their rates were similar in ALAS and 2XALAS, accumulation of this intermediate was greater in the 2XALAS-catalyzed reaction. Collectively, these results suggest that ketoenamine is the active form of the coenzyme and forms a more prominent coenzyme structure in 2XALAS than in ALAS at pH approximately 7.5.

15854045|t|Regulation of the expression of peptidylarginine deiminase type II gene (PADI2) in human keratinocytes involves Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.
15854045|a|Peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) convert protein-bound arginine residues into citrulline residues in a Ca(2+) ion-dependent manner. Among the five isoforms (PAD1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) existing in rodents and humans, PAD2 is the most widely expressed in both species, tissues, and organs. In order to study the mechanisms regulating the expression of the human PAD2 gene, PADI2, we characterized its promoter region using transfected human keratinocytes. A series of reporter gene constructions derived from the 2 kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site defined a minimal promoter sequence from nucleotides -132 to -41. This PADI2 region is GC-rich and lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. Investigation of cis-acting elements in the region, further deletion analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific antibodies revealed four Sp1-binding sites and identified Sp1 and Sp3 as binding factors important for the promoter activity. These results suggest that Sp1/Sp3 cooperation may provide a mechanism to control the transcription of PADI2.

15937104|t|Activator of G protein signaling 3 regulates opiate activation of protein kinase A signaling and relapse of heroin-seeking behavior.
15937104|a|The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is central to heroin addiction. Activation of opiate receptors in the NAc dissociates G(i/o) into alpha and betagamma subunits. Galpha(i) inhibits cAMP production, but betagamma regulates several molecular pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA). We show in NAc/striatal neurons that opiates paradoxically activate PKA signaling by means of betagamma dimers. Activation requires Galpha(i3) and an activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3). AGS3 competes with betagamma for binding to Galpha(i3)-GDP and enhances the action of unbound betagamma. AGS3 and Galpha(i3) knockdown prevents opiate activation of PKA signaling. In rats self-administering heroin, AGS3 antisense in the NAc core, but not shell, eliminates reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior, a model of human relapse. Thus, Galpha(i3)/betagamma/AGS3 appears to mediate mu opiate receptor activation of PKA signaling as well as heroin-seeking behavior.

15992586|t|2-[4-(3,4-Dimethylphenyl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]-1H benzoimidazole (A-381393), a selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist.
15992586|a|2-[4-(3,4-Dimethylphenlyl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]-1H benzoimidazole (A-381393) was identified as a potent dopamine D4 receptor antagonist with excellent receptor selectivity. [3H]-spiperone competition binding assays showed that A-381393 potently bound to membrane from cells expressing recombinant human dopamine D4.4 receptor (Ki=1.5 nM), which was 20-fold higher than that of clozapine (Ki=30.4 nM). A-381393 exhibited highly selective binding for the dopamine D4.4 receptor (>2700-fold) when compared to D1, D2, D3 and D5 dopamine receptors. Furthermore, in comparison to clozapine and L-745870, A-381393 exhibits better receptor selectivity, showing no affinity up to 10 microM for a panel of more than 70 receptors and channels, with the exception of moderate affinity for 5-HT2A (Ki=370 nM). A-381393 potently inhibited the functional activity of agonist-induced GTP-gamma-S binding assay and 1 microM dopamine induced-Ca2+ flux in human dopamine D4.4 receptor expressing cells, but not in human dopamine D2L or D3 receptor cells. In contrast to L-745870, A-381393 did not exhibit any significant intrinsic activity in a D4.4 receptor. In vivo, A-381393 has good brain penetration after subcutaneous administration. A-381393 inhibited penile erection induced by the selective D4 agonist PD168077 in conscious rats. Thus, A-381393 is a novel selective D4 antagonist that will enhance the ability to study dopamine D4 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.

1600046|t|Review article: 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists and antagonists in the modulation of gastrointestinal motility and sensation: clinical implications.
1600046|a|Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is found in the enteric nervous system where it has been implicated in controlling gastrointestinal motor function. A number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The functional role of the 5-HT3 receptor remains incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. A number of selective 5-HT3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron renzapride and zacopride. While the substituted benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block 5-HT3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-HT4 receptor. Some 5-HT3 antagonists have 5-HT4 agonist activity (for example, renzapride, zacopride) and others do not (for example, ondansetron, granisetron), while tropisetron in high concentrations is a 5-HT4 antagonist. Based on the pharmacological data, it has been suggested that specific 5-HT antagonists and agonists may prove to be beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea. In this review, the rationale for the use of these compounds is discussed, and the available experimental evidence is summarized.

16018973|t|Niacin mediates lipolysis in adipose tissue through its G-protein coupled receptor HM74A.
16018973|a|A G-protein coupled receptor to niacin (nicotinic acid) was identified recently but the physiological/pharmacological role of the receptor remains poorly defined. We present our studies to demonstrate that HM74A, but not HM74, binds niacin at high affinities and effectively mediates Gi signaling events in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells as well as in 3T3L1 adipocytes expressing HM74A. Furthermore, HM74A, but not HM74, expressed in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes effectively mediated inhibition of lipolysis by niacin. Our results provided direct evidence indicating that HM74A, but not HM74, was sufficient to mediate anti-lipolytic effect of niacin in adipose tissue.

1612232|t|Islet cell antibodies in normal French schoolchildren.
1612232|a|Islet-cell antibodies have been reported to be of predictive value for the future development of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in first degree relatives of diabetic patients with the risk increasing in these subjects with the islet-cell antibodies titre. However, very little is known about islet-cell antibodies in background populations. Sera (n = 8363) from schoolchildren (6-17 years) in the French background population were screened for the presence of islet-cell antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Islet-cell antibodies greater than 4.5 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units were found in 150 sera (prevalence rate 1.8%; 95% confidence interval 1.5-2.1%). Only 17 sera demonstrated islet-cell antibody titre greater than or equal to 24 JDF units. No particular feature was found to be significantly different between islet-cell antibody-positive and islet-cell antibody-negative children (age, family history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, insulin autoantibodies). A second blood sample was obtained from 80 of 150 islet-cell antibody positive children after a mean interval of 8 months. Only 11 sera became less than 4.5 JDF units with islet-cell antibody titres being stable in the remaining sera, including the high-titre positive sera (greater than or equal to 24 JDF units). HLA-DQB typing was performed by restriction mapping techniques in 80 islet-cell antibody-positive, in 93 islet-cell antibody-negative and in 213 Type 1 diabetic children. The distribution of the susceptibility alleles (DQB1-Asp57-negative) was not significantly different between islet-cell antibody-positive and islet-cell antibody-negative children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

16232421|t|Effect of gene disruptions of the TCA cycle on production of succinic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
16232421|a|Succinate is the main taste component produced by yeasts during sake (Japanese rice wine) fermentation. The pathway leading to accumulation of succinate was examined in liquid culture in the presence of a high concentration (15%) of glucose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using a series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which various genes that encode the expression of enzymes required in TCA cycle were disrupted. When cultured in YPD medium containing 15% glucose under aerobic conditions, the KGD1 (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) gene disrupted mutant produced a lower level of succinate than the wild-type strain, while the SDH1 (succinate dehydrogenase) gene-disrupted mutant produced an increased level of succinate. On the other hand, the FUM1 (fumarase) gene disrupted mutant produced significantly higher levels of fumarate but did not form malate at all. These results indicate that succinate, fumarate and malate are mainly synthesized through the TCA cycle (oxidative direction) even in the presence of glucose at a concentration as high as 15%. When the growth condition was shifted from aerobic to anaerobic, the increased level of succinate in SDH1 disruptants was no longer observed, whereas the decreased level of succinate in the KGD1 diruptant was still observed. A double mutant of the two fumarate reductase isozyme genes (OSM1 and FRDS) showed a succinate productivity of 50% as compared to the parent when cells were incubated in glucose-buffered solution. These results indicate that succinate could be synthesized through two pathways, namely, alpha-ketoglutarate oxidation via the TCA cycle and fumarate reduction under anaerobic conditions.

16268464|t|Association of MTRRA66G polymorphism (but not of MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTRA2756G, TCN C776G) with homocysteine and coronary artery disease in the French population.
16268464|a|Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism (MTHFR C677T) is an established determinant of homocysteine plasma level (t-Hcys) while its association with coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be more limited. In contrast, the association of the substitutions A2756G of methionine synthase (MTR), A66G of methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and C776G of transcobalamin (TCN) to both t-Hcys and CAD needs to be evaluated further. The objective was to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with t-Hcys and CAD in a French population. We investigated the individual and combined effects of these polymorphisms and of vitamin B12 and folates with t-Hcys in 530 CAD patients and 248 matched healthy controls. t-Hcys was higher in the CAD group than in controls (11.8 vs 10.4 microM, P < 0.0001) and in carriers of MTRRAA and MTHFR 677TT than in those carrying the most frequent allele of both polymorphisms (13.8 vs 11.4 microM, P = 0.0102 and 12.5 vs 11.0 mM, P = 0.0065 respectively). The frequency of MTRR A allele was higher in CAD patients than in controls (0.48 [95% CI: 0.44-0.52] vs 0.38 [95% CI: 0.32-0.44], P = 0.0081) while no difference was observed for MTHFR 677T frequency. In multivariate analysis, t-Hcys > median and MTRRAA genotype were two significant independent predictors of CAD with respective odds ratios of 3.1 (95 % CI: 1.8-5.1, P < 0.0001) and 4.5 (95% CI: 1.5-13.1, P = 0.0051). In conclusion, in contrast to North Europe studies, MTRRAA genotype is a genetic determinant of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia associated with CAD in a French population without vitamin fortification.

16292755|t|Vitamin E supplementation alters HDL-cholesterol concentration and paraoxonase activity in rabbits fed high-cholesterol diet: comparison with probucol.
16292755|a|Vitamin E and probucol are well-known antioxidants that prevent cells from the oxidative stress, which is a risk factor of atherosclerosis. Male rabbits were fed either 0.03% vitamin E or 0.05% probucol in a 0.5% high-cholesterol (HC) diet for 8 weeks. Vitamin E and probucol significantly suppressed an increase in plasma total-cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to HC-control group. However, plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL-C/total-C ratio levels and plasma paraoxonase activity were only significantly higher in vitamin E group after 8 weeks. Hepatic ACAT activity was significantly lower in both vitamin E and probucol groups than in HC-control group, while HMG-CoA reductase activity was the highest only in the probucol group. Total fecal sterol content was significantly higher in probucol and vitamin E groups than in the two control groups. Some atherogenic signs were discovered in the aortic fatty streak of HC-control group, yet not in other groups. Hepatic mRNA expressions of apo B-100 and apo C-III were significantly lower in probucol group than in other groups. Vitamin E supplementation was found to alter the plasma HDL-C-related factors; meanwhile, probucol supplementation was very effective in enhancing cholesterol metabolism, except for a negative effect that reduced plasma HDL-C concentration.

To do this we cloned and expressed CCR5 from rhesus macaque and compared the binding properties of [125I]-MIP-1beta and [3H]-maraviroc with human recombinant CCR5. [125I]-MIP-1beta bound with similar high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM) and with similar kinetic properties. In competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque CCR5 was also similar to human CCR5. Maraviroc inhibited binding of [125I]-MIP-1beta to CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nM and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nM, respectively) and antagonised MIP-1beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nM and 12.07 +/- 1.89, respectively). [3H]-maraviroc bound with high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 1.36+/-0.07 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nM), but was found to dissociate approximately 10-fold more quickly from macaque CCR5. However, as with the human receptor, maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque CCR5 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology, safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel CCR5 antagonists.

16316409|t|A novel function of differentiation revealed by cDNA microarray profiling of p75NTR-regulated gene expression.
16316409|a|The expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is diminished in epithelial cells during progression of prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for p75NTR as a tumor suppressor in prostate growth. To better understand the molecular mechanism of p75(NTR) on tumor suppression, we utilized a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray composed of approximately 6,000 human cancer-related genes to determine the gene expression pattern altered by re-introduction of p75NTR into PC-3 prostate tumor cells. Comparison of the transcripts in the neo and p75NTR-transfected cells revealed 52 differentially expressed genes, of which 21 were up-regulated and 31 were down-regulated in the presence of p75NTR. Based on the known biological functions of the p75NTR-regulated genes, we observed that p75NTR modulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of differentiation as well as cell adhesion, signal transduction, apoptosis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. Several differentially expressed genes identified by microarray were selected for confirmation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunoblot analysis further confirmed increased cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I (CRABPI) and IGFBP5 protein levels and decreased level of PLAUR protein with increasing p75NTR protein expression. As CRABPI was elevated far more than any other genes, we observed that the retinoids, all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, that bind CRABPI, promoted nitroblue tetrazolium-associated functional cell differentiation in p75NTR PC-3 cells, but not in neo control PC-3 cells. Subsequent examination of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) expression levels demonstrated an absence of RAR-beta in the neo control cells and re-expression in the p75NTR expressing cells, consistent with previous findings where RAR-beta is believed to play a critical role as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost during de-differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. Whereas the RAR-alpha and -gamma protein levels remained unchanged, retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha and -beta also exhibited increasing protein levels with re-expression of the p75NTR protein. Moreover, the ability of p75NTR siRNA to knockdown levels of RAR-beta, RXR-alpha, and RXR-beta supports the specificity of the functional involvement of p75NTR in differentiation. Hence, re-expression of the p75NTR appears to partially reverse de-differentiation of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating the expression of CRABPI for localized sequestration of retinoids that are available to newly up-regulated RAR-beta, RXR-alpha, and RXR-beta.

16322797|t|GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing.
16322797|a|Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug. Its special profile of actions, especially the rise in HDL-cholesterol levels induced by nicotinic acid, is unique among the currently available pharmacological tools to treat lipid disorders. Recently, a G-protein-coupled receptor, termed GPR109A (HM74A in humans, PUMA-G in mice), was described and shown to mediate the nicotinic acid-induced antilipolytic effects in adipocytes. One of the major problems of the pharmacotherapeutical use of nicotinic acid is a strong flushing response. This side effect, although harmless, strongly affects patient compliance. In the present study, we show that mice lacking PUMA-G did not show nicotinic acid-induced flushing. In addition, flushing in response to nicotinic acid was also abrogated in the absence of cyclooxygenase type 1, and mice lacking prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptors had reduced flushing responses. The mouse orthologue of GPR109A, PUMA-G, is highly expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, and transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiated PUMA-G-deficient mice restored the nicotinic acid-induced flushing response. Our data clearly indicate that GPR109A mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing and that this effect involves release of PGE(2) and PGD(2), most likely from immune cells of the skin.

16325050|t|The Arg389Gly beta1-adrenoceptor polymorphism and catecholamine effects on plasma-renin activity.
16325050|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to find out whether, in humans, dobutamine-induced hemodynamic effects and increase in plasma-renin activity (PRA) might be beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1AR) genotype-dependent. BACKGROUND: In vitro Arg389Gly-beta1AR polymorphism exhibits decreased receptor signaling. METHODS: We studied 10 male homozygous Arg389-beta1AR subjects and 8 male homozygous Gly389beta1AR subjects; to avoid influences of codon 49 polymorphism, all were homozygous Ser49-beta1AR. Subjects were infused with dobutamine (1 to 6 microg/kg/min) with or without bisoprolol (10 mg orally) pretreatment, and PRA, heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure were assessed. RESULTS: With regard to PRA, dobutamine increased PRA more potently in Arg389-beta1AR versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol markedly suppressed the dobutamine-induced PRA increase in Arg389- but only marginally in Gly389-beta1AR subjects. With regard to hemodynamics, dobutamine caused larger heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol reduced dobutamine-induced heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases more potently in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Codon 389 beta1AR polymorphism is a determinant not only of hemodynamic effects but also of PRA. Thus, beta1AR polymorphisms may be useful for predicting therapeutic responses to betaAR-blocker treatment.

16344985|t|Valproic acid selectively inhibits conversion of arachidonic acid to arachidonoyl-CoA by brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases: relevance to bipolar disorder.
16344985|a|RATIONALE: Several drugs used to treat bipolar disorder (lithium and carbamazepine), when administered chronically to rats, reduce the turnover of arachidonic acid, but not docosahexaenoic acid, in brain phospholipids by decreasing the activity of an arachidonic acid-selective phospholipase A(2). Although chronic valproic acid produces similar effects on brain arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid turnover, it does not alter phospholipase A(2) activity, suggesting that it targets a different enzyme in the turnover pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS/RESULTS: By isolating rat brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl), we show in vitro that valproic acid is a non-competitive inhibitor of Acsl, as it reduces the maximal velocity of the reaction without changing the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. While valproic acid inhibited the synthesis of arachidonoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and docosahexaenoyl-CoA, the K (i )for inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA synthesis (14.1 mM) was approximately one fifth the K (i) for inhibiting palmitoyl-CoA (85.4 mM) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (78.2 mM) synthesis. As chronic administration of valproic acid in bipolar disorder achieves whole-brain levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mM, inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA formation can occur at brain concentrations that are therapeutically relevant to this disease. Furthermore, brain microsomal Acsl did not produce valproyl-CoA. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that valproic acid acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of brain microsomal Acsl, and that inhibition is substrate-selective. The study supports the hypothesis that valproic acid acts in bipolar disorder by reducing the brain arachidonic acid cascade, by inhibiting arachidonoyl-CoA formation.

16359899|t|From an inborn error patient to a search for regulatory meaning: a biotin conducted voyage.
16359899|a|This article summarizes some findings of a research that I have pursued for the past 25 years, whose roots are immersed in the field of inherited metabolic disorders, and deal with different aspects of the vitamin biotin, starting with a patient with multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD). Several of MCD clinical manifestations resemble those of infant malnutrition; we demonstrated that about one-third of infants with this common nutritional disorder were indeed biotin-deficient, and that this deficiency is metabolically significant, by studying urine instead of blood, studying urinary organic acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Remarkably, the metabolic abnormalities became apparent only after protein feeding was started, suggesting that this phenomenon may contribute to the worsening of malnourished individuals when they are abruptly fed. Afterwards, we studied biotin deficiency at the tissue level. Carboxylase activities and masses were significantly reduced in liver, kidney, muscle, adipose tissue, intestine, and spleen, but brain and heart were spared; their mRNAs remained unchanged. On the other hand, holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) mRNA levels were markedly low in the deficient animals, and increased upon biotin injection. Over 2000 human genes have been identified that depend on biotin for expression. To probe into the "logic" of this enigma, we have started comparative studies among evolutionarily distant organisms, such as mouse and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we are now looking for biotin effects on specific genes and proteins, such as HCS and hexokinases, and on their proteomes.

16371234|t|Involvement of COX-1 and up-regulated prostaglandin E synthases in phosphatidylserine liposome-induced prostaglandin E2 production by microglia.
16371234|a|After engulfment of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine (PS)-mediated recognition, microglia secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent anti-inflammatory molecule in the central nervous system. Despite the clinical significance, the mechanism underlying PGE2 production by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we used PS liposomes to elucidate the phagocytic pathway for PGE2 production in microglia, because PS liposomes mimic the effects of apoptotic cells on microglia/macrophages. The level of PGE2 in the culture medium of primary cultured rat microglia was significantly increased by PS liposomes treatment but not by phosphatidylcholine liposomes treatment. The specific ligand for class B scavenger receptor (SR-B), high density lipoprotein, significantly suppressed PS liposome-induced PGE2 production. PS liposomes were immediately phagocytosed by microglia and sorted to endosomes/lysosomes. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) were induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not with PS liposomes. On the other hand, mPGES-2 and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) that are functionally coupled with COX-1 were upregulated after treatment with PS liposomes or LPS. Furthermore, PS liposome-induced PGE2 production was significantly suppressed by indomethacin, a preferential COX-1 inhibitor, but not by NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. PS liposomes induced activation of p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SR-BI independent manner. These observations strongly suggest that the up-regulation of terminal PGESs that are preferentially coupled with COX-1, especially mPGES-2, plays the pivotal role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production by microglia. Although SR-BI plays an essential role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production, other PS-recognizing receptors, possibly PS-specific receptor, could also promote PGE2 production by transducing intracellular signals including p44/p42 ERK after PS liposomes treatment.

16425993|t|Sorafenib: scientific rationales for single-agent and combination therapy in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.
16425993|a|Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by the loss of von Hippel-Lindau disease protein and the resultant dysregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta)/PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Raf pathways, which contribute to angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor cell growth and survival. Significant advances in the treatment of clear-cell RCC have been derived from agents that target these pathways, including the multiple-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) sorafenib, sunitinib, and AG013736, which target multiple VEGFRs as well as PDGFR-beta. Sorafenib has the added advantage of inhibiting multiple different Raf isoforms, which enables it to target TGF-alpha/EGFR signaling and may also enhance its inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR-beta. This review will examine the recent advances in our understanding of the biology of clear-cell RCC and show how those advances have helped delineate new targets of opportunity for treatment. It will also present the early clinical results of agents that target the pathways dysregulated in clear-cell RCC, with special emphasis on sorafenib and the other active MKIs, and will describe the scientific rationales for ongoing and future sorafenib-based combination therapy trials in RCC.

16449956|t|A case of adult-onset type II citrullinemia--deterioration of clinical course after infusion of hyperosmotic and high sugar solutions.
16449956|a|BACKGROUND: Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of SLC25A13 gene encoding citrin and is characterized by recurrent encephalopathy with hyperammonemia. Factors affecting disease progression remain unknown. We report a case with CTLN2, whose clinical course was rapidly worsened by the administration of Glyceol, a hyperosmotic diuretic solution consisting of 10% glycerol and 5% fructose in saline. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old man was admitted in coma after repeated episodes of altered consciousness. His plasma ammonia level was markedly elevated without any evidence of liver diseases. Brain MRI revealed high signal intensities at the bilateral cingulate gyri and insular cortices, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy. We administered Glyceol. intravenously to alleviate brain edema, however, he developed intractable seizures along with steep increase in plasma ammonia levels (from 808 to 2210 microg/dL) and died. The diagnosis of CTLN2 was confirmed by elevations of plasma citrulline level (384.3 nmol/mL; normal 17-43 nmol/mL) and serum pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) (110 ng/mL; normal 4.6-12.2 ng/mL), decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase activity (5.5% of control), lack of hepatic citrin protein expression and mutations in SLC25A13 gene (compound heterozygote with S225X and Ex1-1G>A). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should take CTLN2 into consideration as a differential diagnosis in Asian patients with a history of repeated unconsciousness with hyperammonemia and use D-mannitol but not glycerol to treat brain edema in patients with CTLN2.

16488503|t|Inhibition of gentamicin binding to rat renal brush-border membrane by megalin ligands and basic peptides.
16488503|a|Our previous studies showed that coadministration of cytochrome c and a 20-residue basic peptide, N-WASP181-200 (NISHTKEKKKGKAKKKRLTK, pI=10.87) inhibits renal accumulation of gentamicin. In this study, we examined effects of ligands of megalin, an endocytic receptor involved in renal uptake of gentamicin, and basic peptides including N-WASP180-200 and its mutant peptides on gentamicin binding to isolated rat renal brush-border membrane (BBM). Gentamicin binding to BBM was inhibited by megalin ligands, basic peptide fragments of cytochrome c, and N-WASP181-200 in a concentration-dependent manner. Klotz plot analysis showed that N-WASP181-200 inhibited the binding of gentamicin in a competitive manner. By substituting glycines for lysines in N-WASP181-200 at positions 9 and 15, the inhibitory effect on gentamicin binding to BBM was reduced, which may be related to a decrease in the alpha-helix content in the peptide. Gentamicin binding to BBM treated with trypsin, in which megalin completely disappeared, was significantly but not completely decreased compared with the native BBM. In addition, treatment of BBM with trypsin led to a decrease in the inhibitory effect of N-WASP181-200 on gentamicin binding. These observations support that megalin ligands and basic peptides including N-WASP181-200 decrease renal accumulation of gentamicin by inhibiting its binding to BBM of proximal tubule cells, partly interacting with megalin. In addition, the alpha-helix conformation may play an important role in the inhibitory effect of N-WASP181-200 on the binding of gentamicin to BBM.

16596248|t|Thymidylate synthase expression pattern, expression level and single nucleotide polymorphism are predictors for disease-free survival in patients of colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil.
16596248|a|Several variables associated to thymidylate synthase (TS), the biological target of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) have been studied for their possible role as predictors of the clinical outcome and response to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The level of protein expression and the number of variable tandem-repeats of a 28-bp sequence within the gene promoter have been proposed as predictive and/or prognostic factors with variable agreement, while consensus seems to be achieved with respect to the value of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) described within this same region. More recently, an association between TS expression pattern and survival has been disclosed. Paraffin-embedded sections from 140 CRC patients were analyzed by immuno-histochemistry (Mab TS106) for TS levels and expression pattern. Also, VNTR and SNP were determined by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and restriction-length-fragment polymorphism (RFLP) in 123 and 112 patients, respectively. Cytoplasmic expression pattern tended to be associated to C SNP (p=0.06). Low TS expression levels, cytoplasmic expression pattern and C SNP arose as variables associated to longer progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with 5FU. Accordingly, patients having at least two favourable or unfavourable variables were classified respectively as 'low risk' and 'high risk', the former showing significantly longer PFS (p=0.0299). The possibility for designing a selection method for subsequent therapies is suggested on the basis of a probable combined effect of the above mentioned parameters but further studies in larger populations are needed to confirm these results.

16597468|t|Leishmania donovani singly deficient in HGPRT, APRT or XPRT are viable in vitro and within mammalian macrophages.
16597468|a|Leishmania species express three phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT), which enable this genus to acquire purine nutrients from their hosts. To test whether any of these enzymes is essential for viability, transformation into amastigotes, and infectivity and proliferation within mammalian macrophages, Deltahgprt, Deltaaprt, and Deltaxprt null mutants were created by targeted gene replacement within a virulent background of Leishmania donovani. Each of the three knockout strains was viable as promastigotes and axenic amastigotes and capable of maintaining an infection in bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. These data support the hypothesis that none of the three phosphoribosyltransferases is essential for purine salvage or viability by itself and that purine salvage occurs through multiple anabolic routes in both parasite life cycle stages. In addition these studies revealed the presence of an adenine aminohydrolase enzyme in L. donovani axenic amastigotes, an activity previously thought to be restricted to promastigotes.

16597625|t|Loss of a primordial identity element for a mammalian mitochondrial aminoacylation system.
16597625|a|In mammalian mitochondria the translational machinery is of dual origin with tRNAs encoded by a simplified and rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) genome and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) coded by the nuclear genome, and imported. Mt-tRNAs are atypical with biased sequences, size variations in loops and stems, and absence of residues forming classical tertiary interactions, whereas synthetases appear typical. This raises questions about identity elements in mt-tRNAs and adaptation of their cognate mt-aaRSs. We have explored here the human mt-aspartate system in which a prokaryotic-type AspRS, highly similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme, recognizes a bizarre tRNA(Asp). Analysis of human mt-tRNA(Asp) transcripts confirms the identity role of the GUC anticodon as in other aspartylation systems but reveals the non-involvement of position 73. This position is otherwise known as the site of a universally conserved major aspartate identity element, G73, also known as a primordial identity signal. In mt-tRNA(Asp), position 73 can be occupied by any of the four nucleotides without affecting aspartylation. Sequence alignments of various AspRSs allowed placing Gly-269 at a position occupied by Asp-220, the residue contacting G73 in the crystallographic structure of E. coli AspRS-tRNA(Asp) complex. Replacing this glycine by an aspartate renders human mt-AspRS more discriminative to G73. Restriction in the aspartylation identity set, driven by a rapid mutagenic rate of the mt-genome, suggests a reverse evolution of the mt-tRNA(Asp) identity elements in regard to its bacterial ancestor.

16642960|t|Metabolic syndrome: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and malonyl coenzyme A.
16642960|a|The metabolic syndrome can be defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, premature atherosclerosis, and other diseases. An increasing body of evidence has linked the metabolic syndrome to abnormalities in lipid metabolism that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction. We review here the hypothesis that, in many instances, the cause of these lipid abnormalities could be a dysregulation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism. Such dysregulation could be reflected by isolated increases in malonyl CoA or by concurrent changes in malonyl CoA and AMPK, both of which would alter intracellular fatty acid partitioning. The possibility is also raised that pharmacological agents and other factors that activate AMPK and/or decrease malonyl CoA could be therapeutic targets.

1665782|t|Chronic effect of [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin on rat brain opioid receptors.
1665782|a|In previous studies, we have demonstrated that chronic etorphine or [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) treatment of rats results in the reduction of mu- and delta-opioid receptor binding activities as tolerance develops. As both etorphine and DADLE are relatively non-specific opioid ligands, interacting with both mu- and delta-receptors, these studies could not determine whether down-regulation of a specific receptor type occurs. Therefore, in the present studies, animals were rendered tolerant to the delta-opioid receptor-selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), and receptor binding activities were measured. Treating Sprague-Dawley rats with increasing doses of DPDPE (80-160-240-320 micrograms/kg) i.c.v. for 1 to 4 days resulted in a time-dependent increase in the AD50 of DPDPE to elicit an antinociceptive response. When delta-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]DPDPE, a 40-50% decrease in binding in the midbrain and cortex, and 25-35% decrease in binding in the striatum were observed after 3 or 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Scatchard analysis of the [3H]DPDPE saturation binding data revealed a decrease in Bmax values and no significant change in Kd values. To our surprise, when mu-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO), a 10-15% decrease in binding was also observed in the midbrain and cortex after 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Our conclusion is that chronic DPDPE treatment preferentially reduces delta-opioid receptor binding activity. Its minor effect on the mu-opioid receptor maybe due to an interaction between delta cx and mu cx binding sites.

1666997|t|[Preclinical pharmacology of amoxapine and amitriptyline. Implications of serotoninergic and opiodergic systems in their central effect in rats].
1666997|a|The effects of two antidepressant drugs, amoxapine and amitriptyline, that belong to distinct chemical classes, have been examined on various biochemical parameters related to serotoninergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the rat brain and spinal cord. In vitro binding studies showed that both amoxapine and amitriptyline interact in the nanomolar range with 5-HT2 receptors labelled by [3H]ketanserin in cortical membranes. By contrast, neither amoxapine nor amitriptyline can be considered as possible ligands of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors because their affinities for these sites are in the micromolar range (or even worse). Interestingly, amoxapine binds with a good affinity (IC50 = 0.30 microM) to 5-HT3 receptors labelled by [3H]zacopride in cortical membranes. Complementary experiments using the 5-HT3-dependent Bezold-Jarisch reflex confirmed that amoxapine really acts in vivo as a 5-HT3 antagonist (IC50 = 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), whereas amitriptyline is essentially inactive on 5-HT3 receptors. The second part of this study consisted of looking for possible changes in central 5-HT receptors 24 h after either a single or a repeated (for 14 days) treatment with amoxapine (10 mg/kg i.p. each day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.). A marked decrease in the density of 5-HT2 receptors was found in the cerebral cortex in both treatment groups. By contrast, neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT1B receptors were significantly affected in any brain region studied. Finally we explored whether acute and/or chronic administration of amoxapine or amitriptyline affected the levels of opioid peptides and the mu and delta classes of opioid receptors in various regions of the brain and the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

16675639|t|Desvenlafaxine succinate: A new serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
16675639|a|The purpose of this study was to characterize a new chemical entity, desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS). DVS is a novel salt form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Competitive radioligand binding assays were performed using cells expressing either the human serotonin (5-HT) transporter (hSERT) or norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) with K(i) values for DVS of 40.2 +/- 1.6 and 558.4 +/- 121.6 nM, respectively. DVS showed weak binding affinity (62% inhibition at 100 microM) at the human dopamine (DA) transporter. Inhibition of [3H]5-HT or [3H]NE uptake by DVS for the hSERT or hNET produced IC50 values of 47.3 +/- 19.4 and 531.3 +/- 113.0 nM, respectively. DVS (10 microM), examined at a large number of nontransporter targets, showed no significant activity. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) rapidly penetrated the male rat brain and hypothalamus. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) significantly increased extracellular NE levels compared with baseline in the male rat hypothalamus but had no effect on DA levels using microdialysis. To mimic chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment and to block the inhibitory 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclo hexanecarboxamide maleate salt (WAY-100635) (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), was administered with DVS (30 mg/kg orally). 5-HT increased 78% compared with baseline with no additional increase in NE or DA levels. In conclusion, DVS is a new 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor in vitro and in vivo that demonstrates good brain-to-plasma ratios, suggesting utility in a variety of central nervous system-related disorders.

16719540|t|How may anticancer chemotherapy with fluorouracil be individualised?
16719540|a|Fluorouracil is used clinically against various solid tumours. Both fluorouracil toxicity and pharmacokinetics vary highly within and between individuals. The reasons why doses are not individualised routinely are difficulties in defining, predicting and achieving an optimal fluorouracil exposure or dose because of a narrow therapeutic index, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, variabilities in administration rates and metabolism, and in targets like thymidylate synthase. To individualise fluorouracil administration before the first dose, assessment of the individual dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity may be useful, because this genetically highly polymorphic enzyme controls approximately 80% of fluorouracil elimination. A complete or partial loss of DPD activity in 0.1 and 3-5% of Caucasians, respectively, leads to increased fluorouracil exposure and toxicity. Several methods to assess DPD activity in patients have been proposed (genotyping, various phenotyping methods), but each of them has limitations, as has the fluorouracil test dose approach. To adapt exposure towards fluorouracil a priori, a combination of genotyping and phenotyping may yield better prediction of toxicity than one method alone. A prerequisite for dose adaptation is the definition of fluorouracil exposure ranges with sufficient therapeutic activity, but without serious toxicity. While an increased risk of leukopenia, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome during continuous 5-day infusions was related to fluorouracil exposures above an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) threshold of 25-30 mg.h/L, tumour response was higher when an AUC of approximately 30 mg.h/L was achieved, illustrating the extremely narrow therapeutic window of fluorouracil. Pharmacokinetic target values are less clear for other regimens, including chronomodulated regimens, which yielded a superior clinically efficacy and tolerability in several trials. However, the monitoring of fluorouracil plasma concentrations seems principally useful for individual a posteriori dose adjustment. Whether an adaptation of the fluorouracil starting dose to the results of two DPD activity tests before fluorouracil administration a priori, and the adaptation of doses to fluorouracil exposure a posteriori is a reasonable approach to better prevent toxicity and increase efficacy, remains to be evaluated in randomised clinical studies comparing these strategies to routine clinical safety monitoring.

16741658|t|Expression of basic fibroblast growth factor correlates with resistance to paclitaxel in human patient tumors.
16741658|a|BACKGROUND: Preclinical results indicate acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) present in solid tumors as a cause of broad-spectrum chemoresistance, whereas earlier clinical studies suggest that bFGF expression is associated with opposing outcomes in patients. We investigated the relationship between FGF expression and paclitaxel activity in tumors from bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumors (n = 96) were maintained in three-dimensional histocultures, retaining tumor-stromal interaction. Bladder tumors were treated with paclitaxel for 2 h, and the other tumors for 24 h. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel were quantified and correlated with expression of aFGF, bFGF, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), p53, and bcl-2. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent (49/96) and 63% (61/96) of tumors showed aFGF and bFGF staining, respectively. aFGF expression was positively correlated with tumor stage (p < 0.01), and bFGF expression with tumor grade and Pgp expression (p < 0.05). Paclitaxel inhibited antiproliferation in 86% of tumors (83/96), with an average inhibition of 46 +/- 19% (mean +/- SD) in the responding tumors. Paclitaxel also induced apoptosis in 96% of tumors (92/96), with an average apoptotic index of 12 +/- 7% in the responding tumors. aFGF expression did not correlate with tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas bFGF expression showed an inverse correlation (p < 0.01). bFGF expression was a stronger predictor of paclitaxel resistance compared to Pgp, p53, or Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: These results support a role of bFGF in paclitaxel resistance in human patient tumors.

16741870|t|Thyroid hormone receptor expression in the obligatory paedomorphic salamander Necturus maculosus.
16741870|a|Amphibian metamorphosis is under the strict control of thyroid hormones (TH). These hormones induce metamorphosis by controlling gene expression through binding to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Necturus maculosus is considered to be an obligatory paedomorphic Amphibian since metamorphosis never occurs spontaneously and cannot be induced by pharmacological means. Since metamorphosis depends on the acquisition of response of tadpole tissues to thyroid hormone, we aimed to determine TR gene expression patterns in Necturus maculosus as well as the expression of two TH-related genes: Cytosolic Thyroid Hormone-Binding Protein (CTHBP)-M2-pyruvate kinase, a gene encoding a cytosolic TH binding protein and stromelysin 3, a direct TH target gene in Xenopus laevis. Tissue samples were obtained from specimens of Necturus maculosus. We performed in situ hybridization using non-cross-hybridizing RNA probes obtained from the cloned Necturus TRalpha and TRbeta genes. We found clear expression of Necturus TRalpha gene in several tissues including the central nervous system, epithelial cells of digestive and urinary organs, as well as myocardium and skeletal muscle. TRbeta was also expressed in the brain. In other tissues, hybridization signals were too low to draw reliable conclusions about their precise distribution. In addition, we observed that the expression of CTHBP and ST3 is largely distinct from that of TRs. The fact that we observed a clear expression of TRalpha and TRbeta which are evolutionary conserved, suggests that Necturus tissues express TRs. Our results thus indicate that, in contrast to previously held hypotheses, Necturus tissues are TH responsive.

16763553|t|Regulation of retinal dehydrogenases and retinoic acid synthesis by cholesterol metabolites.
16763553|a|Retinoic acid (RA) constitutes the major active ingredient of vitamin A and is required for various biological processes. The tissue RA level is maintained through a cascade of metabolic reactions where retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs) catalyze the terminal reaction of RA biosynthesis from retinal, a rate-limiting step. We showed that dietary supplement of cholesterol enhanced the expression of RALDH1 and 2 genes and the cellular RA content in vital organs such as brain, kidney, liver and heart. Consistently, the cholesterol-lowering agent (pravastatin sodium) downregulated the expression of RALDH1 and 2 genes in several organs especially the liver and in cultured liver cells. Further, cholesterol metabolites, predominantly the oxysterols, the natural ligands for liver X receptor (LXR), induced these genes via upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) that bound to the regulatory regions of these genes. Knockdown of LXRalpha/beta or SREBP-1c downregulated the expression of RALDH genes, which could be rescued by re-expressing SREBP-1c, suggesting SREBP-1c as a direct positive regulator for these genes. This study uncovered a novel crosstalk between cholesterol and RA biosynthesis.

16769115|t|Reelin down-regulation in mice and psychosis endophenotypes.
16769115|a|Reelin, a large glycoprotein secreted by telencephalic GABAergic neurons, plays an important role in neuronal guidance embryonically and in synaptic plasticity postnatally. The reeler heterozygous mouse (+/rl) appears superficially normal but has been of interest as an animal model for psychosis since the discovery that reelin is 50% down-regulated in postmortem psychotic brain. Brain abnormalities in +/rl are similar to psychotic brain and include a reduction in glutamic acid de carboxylase 67 (GAD67), dendritic arbors and spine density in cortex and hippocampus, and abnormalities in synaptic function including long-term potentiation (LTP). In spite of these abnormalities, behavioral abnormalities in +/rl are subtle and controversial. Recent findings indicate that the reelin (RELN) and GAD67 promoters are hypermethylated in GABAergic neurons of psychotic postmortem brain and that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is up-regulated. Hypermethlyation of RELN and GAD67 promoters can be induced by treating mice with methionine, and these mice display brain and behavioral abnormalities similar to +/rl. Thus, an animal model that combines genetic heterozygocity with epigenesis holds promise for understanding the role of Reelin down-regulation in psychosis.

16775509|t|Functional and bioenergetic consequences of AT1 antagonist olmesartan medoxomil in hearts with postinfarction LV remodeling.
16775509|a|The structural left ventricular (LV) remodeling and contractile dysfunction of hearts with postinfarction LV remodeling are benefited by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker. However, the myocardial bioenergetic consequences of AT1 blocker in these hearts are not known. To investigate, we used a porcine model of postinfarction LV remodeling produced by ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery. After infarction, 7 pigs received olmesartan medoxomil (2 mg/kg) for comparison against 9 untreated and 10 normal pigs. Measurements of hemodynamics, myocardial perfusion, and myocardial bioenergetics were taken 7 weeks postinfarction. The treated group had an LV-to-body weight ratio significantly lower than the untreated group (2.69 +/- 0.70, 2.96 +/- 0.51, 3.66 +/- 0.60 g/kg for control, treated, and untreated groups, respectively). The untreated group had a mean aortic pressure significantly higher than the control (73 +/- 16, 86 +/- 14, and 94 +/- 20 mm Hg, respectively). The subendocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios of the treated group were significantly higher than that of the untreated group. The untreated group, but not the treated group, had significant reductions in mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase subunits compared with controls. Congestive heart failure as evidenced by significant ascites (100 to 2000 mL) developed in 4 of the 9 untreated animals, but was absent in the treated group. Animals with heart failure demonstrated reductions in both mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase expression and myocardial high-energy phosphate levels. Thus, severe LV dysfunction and accompanying abnormal myocardial bioenergetic phenotype were prevented by the AT1 antagonist olmesartan medoxomil.

16782282|t|Regulation of retinoic acid receptors alpha, beta and retinoid X receptor alpha after sciatic nerve injury.
16782282|a|Cell culture experiments indicated that activation of the retinoic acid signaling system is involved in axonal regeneration. This hypothesis was tested with sciatic nerve injury in the rat. Since the effect of retinoic acid is mediated via retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors, we investigated mRNA and protein expression of these receptors during injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. Seven days after crush injury, transcript concentrations of all retinoic acid receptors and of retinoid X receptor alpha were significantly higher than in non-lesioned nerves. Protein levels of retinoic acid receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptor beta and retinoid X receptor alpha were upregulated 4, 7 and 14 days after injury. In degenerating nerves a significant increase of retinoic acid receptor alpha was detected 7 and 14 days, and of retinoic acid receptor beta 14 and 21 days after complete transection. Immunohistochemical staining of retinoid receptors revealed their expression in Schwann cells and macrophages. In addition, we observed that retinoic acid receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor alpha appeared in the cell nuclei of macrophages during the lesion-induced inflammatory reaction, and that retinoid X receptor alpha-staining co-localized with some regenerating axons. Experiments with Schwann cell primary cultures revealed an effect of retinoic acid on the expression of the neuregulin receptor ErbB3, suggesting that one function of retinoic acid consists in the regulation of neuroglial interactions after peripheral nerve injury.

16782438|t|Cellular effects of imatinib on medullary thyroid cancer cells harboring multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 2A and 2B associated RET mutations.
16782438|a|BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in the RET gene, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor, often cause medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Surgical resection is the only curative treatment; no effective systemic treatment is available. We evaluated imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as a potential drug for systemic treatment of MTC, in 2 MTC-derived cell lines expressing multiple endocrine neoplasia-associated mutant RET receptors. METHODS: We determined RET expression and Y1062 phosphorylation using Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We determined the effects on cell proliferation by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with annexin V/propidium iodide staining to study imatinib-induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell death. RESULTS: Imatinib inhibited RET Y1062 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner after 1.5 hours of exposure. After 16 hours both RET Y1062 phosphorylation and protein expression levels were affected. Dose-dependent decreases in cell proliferation of both cell lines after exposure to imatinib with inhibitory concentration of 50% levels of 23 +/- 2 micromol/L and 25 +/- 4 micromol/L were seen. These values are high, compared with those for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We further could show that imatinib induced cell-cycle arrest, and apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib inhibits RET-mediated MTC cell growth affecting RET protein levels in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of imatinib necessary to inhibit RET in vitro, however, makes it impossible to conclude that imatinib monotherapy will be a good option for systemic therapy of MTC.

16784786|t|Cell biology of molybdenum.
16784786|a|The transition element molybdenum (Mo) is of essential importance for (nearly) all biological systems as it is required by enzymes catalyzing diverse key reactions in the global carbon, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. The metal itself is biologically inactive unless it is complexed by a special cofactor. With the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, where Mo is a constituent of the FeMo-cofactor, Mo is bound to a pterin, thus forming the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) which is the active compound at the catalytic site of all other Mo-enzymes. In eukaryotes, the most prominent Mo-enzymes are (1) sulfite oxidase, which catalyzes the final step in the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids and is involved in detoxifying excess sulfite, (2) xanthine dehydrogenase, which is involved in purine catabolism and reactive oxygen production, (3) aldehyde oxidase, which oxidizes a variety of aldehydes and is essential for the biosynthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid, and in autotrophic organisms also (4) nitrate reductase, which catalyzes the key step in inorganic nitrogen assimilation. All Mo-enzymes, except plant sulfite oxidase, need at least one more redox active center, many of them involving iron in electron transfer. The biosynthesis of Moco involves the complex interaction of six proteins and is a process of four steps, which also includes iron as well as copper in an indispensable way. Moco as released after synthesis is likely to be distributed to the apoproteins of Mo-enzymes by putative Moco-carrier proteins. Xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase, but not sulfite oxidase and nitrate reductase, require the post-translational sulfuration of their Mo-site for becoming active. This final maturation step is catalyzed by a Moco-sulfurase enzyme, which mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent manner as typical for cysteine desulfurases.

16819260|t|[Retinoid therapy for autoimmune diseases].
16819260|a|Retinoid is a collective term for compounds which bind to and activate retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, beta, gamma and RXRalpha, beta, gamma), members of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The most important endogeneous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which is an RARalpha, beta and gamma ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.

16828882|t|Simvastatin regulates non-neuronal cholinergic activity in T lymphocytes via CD11a-mediated pathways.
16828882|a|Lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. We previously showed that antithymocyte globulin stimulates an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system in T cells via LFA-1-mediated pathways, as evidenced by increases in acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA expression. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits LFA-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on CD11a (LFA-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. In the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin modulates lymphocytic cholinergic activity in T cells. We found that anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody (mAb) increased ChAT activity, ACh synthesis and release, and expression of ChAT and M5 muscarinic ACh receptor mRNA in MOLT-3 cells, a human leukemic T cell line. Simvastatin abolished these anti-CD11a mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. These results indicate that LFA-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via CD11a-mediated pathways, and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.

16829128|t|More than cool: promiscuous relationships of menthol and other sensory compounds.
16829128|a|Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many "sensory compounds" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.

16854582|t|Effect of keratinocyte growth factor on cell viability in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.
16854582|a|In normal prostate, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), also known as fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) serves as a paracrine growth factor synthesized in stromal cells that acts on epithelial cells through its receptor, KGFR. KGF and KGFR were found in human cancer epithelial cells as well as stromal cells. Since KGF expressed in epithelial cells of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in prostate cancer, it has been suggested that KGF might act as an autocrine factor in BPH and prostate cancer. To investigate the roles of KGF in cancerous stroma, primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells (PCSCs) were isolated and evaluated. These PCSCs possessed estrogen receptors and KGFR, but not androgen receptor as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. KGF exhibited mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects that correlated with induction of cyclin-D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and phospho-Akt expression in PCSCs, where treatment with KGF antiserum abolished cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic protein expression. PCSCs exposed to KGF for various time periods resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent up-regulation of Bcl-2. KGF modulated dynamic protein expression indicated that KGF triggered cell cycle machinery and then activated anti-apoptotic actions in PCSCs. Cell proliferation analysis indicated that tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner; however, KGF prevented this inhibition, which further demonstrated KGF triggered anti-apoptotic machinery through activating Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt expression. In summary, KGF has an autocrine effect and serves as a survival factor in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.

16855093|t|The glutamate-aspartate transporter GLAST mediates glutamate uptake at inner hair cell afferent synapses in the mammalian cochlea.
16855093|a|Ribbon synapses formed between inner hair cells (IHCs) and afferent dendrites in the mammalian cochlea can sustain high rates of release, placing strong demands on glutamate clearance mechanisms. To investigate the role of transporters in glutamate removal at these synapses, we made whole-cell recordings from IHCs, afferent dendrites, and glial cells adjacent to IHCs [inner phalangeal cells (IPCs)] in whole-mount preparations of rat organ of Corti. Focal application of the transporter substrate D-aspartate elicited inward currents in IPCs, which were larger in the presence of anions that permeate the transporter-associated anion channel and blocked by the transporter antagonist D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. These currents were produced by glutamate-aspartate transporters (GLAST) (excitatory amino acid transporter 1) because they were weakly inhibited by dihydrokainate, an antagonist of glutamate transporter-1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) and were absent from IPCs in GLAST-/- cochleas. Furthermore, D-aspartate-induced currents in outside-out patches from IPCs exhibited larger steady-state currents than responses elicited by L-glutamate, a prominent feature of GLAST, and examination of cochlea from GLAST-Discosoma red (DsRed) promoter reporter mice revealed that DsRed expression was restricted to IPCs and other supporting cells surrounding IHCs. Saturation of transporters by photolysis of caged D-aspartate failed to elicit transporter currents in IHCs, as did local application of D-aspartate to afferent terminals, indicating that neither presynaptic nor postsynaptic membranes are major sites for glutamate removal. These data indicate that GLAST in supporting cells is responsible for transmitter uptake at IHC afferent synapses.

1687367|t|The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities of labetalol and its RR-SR (50:50) stereoisomers.
1687367|a|1. We compared the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking potencies of labetalol with those of its two stereoisomers (RR and SR) in pithed rats and in homogenized rat cerebral cortex and heart. 2. In pithed rats, labetalol and the RR-SR combination were given orally either at doses of 25 and 50 mg kg-1 body wt. or intravenously at doses of 1 and 5 mg kg-1 body wt. Prazosin 4 and 20 micrograms kg-1 body wt. and propranolol 1 and 5 mg kg-1 body wt., were given intravenously for comparison studies of potency at alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors, respectively. Effects were studied before and after i.v. administration of either phenylephrine (at doses which increased the mean arterial pressure by approximately 80 mmHg) or isoprenaline (at doses that increased heart rate by approximately 100 beats min-1). 3. In pithed rats, labetalol and the RR-SR combination antagonized, in a dose-dependent manner, the pressor effect of phenylephrine (P less than 0.05) and the chronotropic effect of isoprenaline (P less than 0.05). Following both oral and intravenous dosing, the RR-SR combination was twice potent as labetalol in terms of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism at equivalent doses. 4. Labetalol and the enantiomers lacked affinity at alpha 2-adrenoceptors while at alpha 1-adrenoceptors the order of potency was prazosin much greater than RR-SR greater than labetalol. At beta 1-adrenoceptors, the affinity of the compound RR-SR was about 3 times that of labetalol.5. As labetalol is a mixture of active (RR and SR) and inactive (SS and SR) enantiomers (in terms of alpha and beta receptor actions), the combination of RR and SR may be a valuable substitute for labetalol in the treatment of systemic hypertension. Although the potential for non-specific side effects (common to all four enantiomers) could be expected to be diminished, recent reports by postmarketing surveillance indicate that the RR isomer (dilevalol) can induce liver toxicity. Interestingly, labetalol is devoid of this effect; whether the combination of RR and SR enantiomers could be of clinical importance warrants further investigation.

16874462|t|Overexpression of proline oxidase induces proline-dependent and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.
16874462|a|Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

16893531|t|The effects of norepinephrine transporter inactivation on locomotor activity in mice.
16893531|a|BACKGROUND: Acute administration of different classes of antidepressants can enhance or reduce spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, but the effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments are less well characterized. Because norepinephrine is an important regulator of spontaneous locomotor activity, we speculated that norepinephrine transporter blockade contributes to the effects of some antidepressants on spontaneous locomotor activity. METHODS: Antidepressant drugs (reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, venlafaxine, bupropion) were administered acutely (intraperitoneal) or chronically (via osmotic minipump) to control and norepinephrine transporter knockout mice, and spontaneous locomotor activity in novel or familiar environments was recorded. RESULTS: Acute treatment with most norepinephrine transporter-blocking antidepressants decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, whereas chronic treatment decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in both novel and familiar environments. The exception was bupropion, a dual norepinephrine transporter/dopamine transporter blocker, which tended to increase spontaneous locomotor activity. Coadministration of reboxetine and the dopamine transporter blocker GBR 12909 also increased spontaneous locomotor activity. Norepinephrine transporter knockout mice had low basal spontaneous locomotor activity, which was increased by bupropion, whereas reboxetine had no effect in norepinephrine transporter knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or chronic inactivation of the norepinephrine transporter decreases spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments unless coupled with dopamine transporter blockade.

16917142|t|Treatment of Postmenopausal Breast Cancer with Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs).
16917142|a|Endocrine therapy that targets the estrogen receptor (ER) is a standard of care for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. The selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen has been in use for the treatment of advanced breast cancer for more than 30 years and is currently a treatment option for all stages of ER-positive disease. Tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen by binding to the ER, and possesses both ER-agonist and antagonist properties. Unfortunately, long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with several important concerns including an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic complications. In addition, many patients who initially respond to tamoxifen eventually relapse with resistant disease. New treatment approaches are therefore required. A number of alternative SERMs have been tested as substitutes for tamoxifen. These include; toremifene, droloxifene, idoxifene, and keoxifene. Unfortunately, the SERMs have not proved to be more effective than tamoxifen for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and have shown a high level of cross-resistance with tamoxifen. The subsequent development of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is an important therapeutic advance by creating a "no estrogen" environment. Another approach is the development of pure antiestrogens. Fulvestrant is a novel ER antagonist that destroys the ER and its signaling pathway and is not associated with tamoxifen-like agonist effects. It produces high response rates compared with other SERMs and is not cross-resistant to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and is equally as effective as the AI anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who have progressed on prior adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. This review article discusses the significant and continuing value of SERMs for the treatment of postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer.

16926278|t|A 46-amino acid segment in phosphodiesterase-5 GAF-B domain provides for high vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil and is involved in phosphodiesterase-5 dimerization.
16926278|a|Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) contains a catalytic domain (C domain) that hydrolyzes cGMP and a regulatory domain (R domain) that contains two mammalian cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, Escherichia coli FhlAs (GAFs) (A and B) and a phosphorylation site for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (cNPKs). Binding of cGMP to GAF-A increases cNPK phosphorylation of PDE5 and improves catalytic site affinity for cGMP or inhibitors. GAF-B contributes to dimerization of PDE5, inhibition of cGMP binding to GAF-A, and sequestration of the phosphorylation site. To probe potential PDE5 R domain effects on catalytic site affinity for certain inhibitors, four N-terminal truncation mutants were generated: PDE5Delta1-321 contained GAF-B domain, C domain, and the sequence between GAF-A and -B; PDE5Delta1-419 contained GAF-B and C domain; PDE5Delta1-465 contained the C domain and the C-terminal portion of GAF-B; and PDE5Delta1-534 contained only C domain. Truncated proteins with a complete GAF-B were dimers, but those lacking the N-terminal 46 amino acids of GAF-B were monomers, indicating that these residues are vital for GAF-B-mediated PDE5 dimerization. K(m) values of the mutants for cGMP were similar to that of full-length PDE5. All PDE5 constructs had similar affinities for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, sildenafil, tadalafil, and UK-122764, but mutants containing a complete GAF-B had 7- to 18-fold higher affinity for vardenafil-based compounds compared with those lacking a complete GAF-B. This indicated that the N-terminal 46 amino acids in GAF-B are required for high vardenafil potency. This is the first evidence that PDE5 R domain, and GAF-B in particular, influences affinity and selectivity of the catalytic site for certain classes of inhibitors.

16938288|t|Telmisartan downregulates angiotensin II type 1 receptor through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.
16938288|a|OBJECTIVE: Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, was found to have a unique property: it is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Since previous studies have demonstrated that PPARgamma activators suppressed AT1R expression, we examined whether telmisartan affects AT1R expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the thoracic aorta of Wistar-Kyoto rat. Northern and Western blotting analysis were used to examine AT1R mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The DEAE-dextran method was used for transfection, and the promoter activity of AT1R was examined by luciferase assay. RESULTS: Telmisartan decreased the expression of AT1R at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreased AT1R promoter activity with unchanged mRNA stability suggested that telmisartan suppressed AT1R gene expression at the transcriptional level. However, the expression of AT1R was not suppressed by other AT1R antagonists such as candesartan or olmesartan. Since the suppression of AT1R expression was prevented by pretreatment with GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, PPARgamma should have participated in the process. The deletion and mutation analysis of the AT1R gene promoter indicated that a GC box located in the proximal promoter region is responsible for the telmisartan-induced downregulation. CONCLUSION: Our data provides a novel insight into an effect of telmisartan: telmisartan inhibits AT1R gene expression through PPARgamma activation. The dual inhibition of angiotensin II function by telmisartan - AT1R blockade and downregulation - would contribute to more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.

16957773|t|Secretion of L-glutamate from osteoclasts through transcytosis.
16957773|a|Osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. Upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. VGLUT1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates L-glutamate. Osteoclasts secrete L-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with KCl or ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KCl- and ATP-dependent secretion of L-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from VGLUT1-/- knockout mice. Osteoclasts express mGluR8, a class III metabotropic glutamate receptor. Its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of L-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. Finally, it was found that VGLUT1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. Thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released L-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. Glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.

16971132|t|Synthesis, dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, antitumor testing, and molecular modeling study of some new 4(3H)-quinazolinone analogs.
16971132|a|In order to produce potent new leads for anticancer drugs, a new series of quinazoline analogs was designed to resemble methotrexate (MTX, 1) structure features and fitted with functional groups believed to enhance inhibition of mammalian DHFR activity. Molecular modeling studies were used to assess the fit of these compounds within the active site of human DHFR. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit mammalian DHFR in vitro and for their antitumor activity in a standard in vitro tissue culture assay panel. Compounds 28, 30, and 31 were the most active DHFR inhibitors with IC(50) values of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.4microM, respectively. The most active antitumor agents in this study were compounds 19, 31, 41, and 47 with median growth inhibitory concentrations (GI(50)) of 20.1, 23.5, 26.7, and 9.1microM, respectively. Of this series of compounds, only compound 31 combined antitumor potency with potent DHFR inhibition; the other active antitumor compounds (19, 41, and 47) all had DHFR IC(50) values above 15microM, suggesting that they might exert their antitumor potency through some other mode of action. Alternatively, the compounds could differ significantly in uptake or concentration within mammalian cells.

16973729|t|Hyperphagia alters expression of hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor genes and plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.
16973729|a|The central melanocortin (MC) pathway is suggested to mediate satiety signaling downstream of serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors. 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice consume more food, which leads to late-onset obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Ay mice with ectopic expression of the agouti peptide, which leads to a perturbation of the central MC pathway, develop obesity and diabetes, associated with low levels of plasma total ghrelin. Here, we report that 5-wk-old Ay mice consumed more food in association with decreases in levels of plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not active ghrelin, and increases in hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression compared with wild-type mice matched for age and body weight. These alterations were also observed in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Restricted feeding significantly decreased hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression in association with a reversal of the decreases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 5-wk-old Ay mice. Moreover, restricted feeding reduced body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in association with increases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and fenfluramine, both of which induce anorexic effects via 5-HT2C receptors and/or 5-HT1B receptors, suppressed food intake in 5- and 8-wk-old Ay mice, whereas the anorexic effects were attenuated in food-restricted Ay mice. These findings suggest that the agouti peptide down-regulates hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression under restricted feeding conditions, whereas chronic hyperphagia increases the expression of these genes and decreases plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.

16985933|t|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist in the management of prostate cancer.
16985933|a|Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. When treatment is started, LHRH agonists initially stimulate the release of LH, causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a "flare" phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration. Abarelix is a pure GnRH receptor antagonist that is devoid of any LHRH agonist activity. Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that abarelix produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge, as compared with LHRH agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist. The safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment, but the lack of testosterone surge with abarelix might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare.

16988497|t|Diet and gene expression: delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases in healthy Chinese and European subjects.
16988497|a|AIM: To compare the composition of fatty acids (FAs) in diet, and the expression of delta-6 desaturase (D6D) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D) genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between Chinese and Europeans. METHODS: Three-day dietary records from 20 subjects from Beijing, China (n = 10) and Kent, UK (n = 10) were analysed. Expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes of the subjects was determined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The dietary intake of Chinese subjects contained less saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), but more essential fatty acids (EFAs) than that of Europeans. Levels of expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes of Chinese subjects were significantly lower than those of Europeans. A significant positive correlation was found between dietary intake of total SFAs and total MUFAs and expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes, but a significant negative correlation between dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) and the expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes. CONCLUSION: Intake of high SFAs and MUFAs appears to increase expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes, whilst high EFAs intake appears to decrease expression of PBMC D6D and D5D genes. A follow-up study of the expression of D6D and D5D genes in Chinese who live in European countries with high SFA and MUFA diets would be of interest.

17013809|t|The evolution of progesterone receptor ligands.
17013809|a|Progesterone is one of the first nuclear receptor hormones to be described functionally and subsequently approached as a drug target. Because progesterone (1) affects both menstruation and gestation via the progesterone receptor (PR), research aimed at modulating its activity is usually surrounded by controversy. However, ligands for PR were developed into drugs, and their evolution can be crudely divided into three periods: (1) drug-like steroids that mimic the gestational properties of progesterone; (2) drug-like steroids with different properties from progesterone and expanded therapeutic applications; and (3) non-steroidal PR ligands with improved selectivity and modulator properties and further expanded therapeutic applications. Although the latter have yet to see widespread clinical applications, their development is founded on a half century of research, and they represent the future for this drug target.

17023173|t|Decitabine--bedside to bench.
17023173|a|PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Epigenetic changes marked by DNA methylation are known to contribute to the malignant transformation of cells by silencing critical genes. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and has shown therapeutic effects in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the connection between the clinical activity of decitabine and its demethylating activity is not clear. Herein, we summarize the results of recent clinical trials of decitabine in hematologic malignancies, and review the translational research into decitabine's mechanism of clinical activity. RECENT FINDINGS: Low-dose decitabine has been studied recently in multiple clinical trials and has been shown to be effective for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Correlative laboratory studies of clinical trials have shown that decitabine induces global hypomethylation as well as hypomethylation of gene-specific promoters and activation of gene expression. Past a given threshold, induction of higher degrees of hypomethylation is not directly associated with a better clinical outcome. Moreover, studies have suggested that patients with promoter hypermethylation of p15(INK4B) at baseline have paradoxically a lower chance of achieving response than those without hypermethylation. Furthermore, several other genes activated by decitabine were independent of hypomethylation in the promoter regions. CONCLUSION: While at least part of decitabine's activity is through induction of hypomethylation and reactivation of critical genes, mechanisms independent from hypomethylation are also important for decitabine's antitumor activity.

17053736|t|[Efalizumab].
17053736|a|Efalizumab (Raptiva, Serono) is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1) produced by biotechnology. This antibody has a novel place among biotherapies for psoriasis. It is bound to the CD11a subunit of a surface molecule of the T lymphocyte LFA-1 (Leucocyte Function-associated Antigen-1). This molecule is essential for binding of T lymphocytes to the ICAM-1 molecule (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1) found on antigen-presenting cells, endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Binding of efalizumab to CD11a prevents binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, thus inhibiting several steps in the immunological process responsible for formation of psoriatic plaque (activation of naive T lymphocytes to memory T lymphocytes, lymphocyte migration and reactivation of T lymphocytes in skin). Efalizumab was approved in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 2003 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis requiring systemic therapy. It may be used as first-line therapy in the United States in this indication. In France, marketing authorisation (MA) was granted more recently in September 2005. The indications are moderate-to-severe cutaneous plaque psoriasis in adults in cases of failure, intolerance or contraindication of at least two systemic treatments including phototherapy, methotrexate and cyclosporine. Current clinical trial data is available for 3500 patients with plaque psoriasis. A 75% improvement in PASI score was seen in between 22 and 39% of patients treated with efalizumab (vs. 2 to 5% for patients on placebo) in a single weekly subcutaneous injection (1 mg/kg). A study in good responders confirms the continuing long-term efficacy of prescription of the drug up to 36 months (with at least a 75% improvement in PASI score in 53% of patients). However, it is not effective against joint involvement in psoriasis. The most common side-effects (incidence >1/100) are influenza-like syndrome, risk of outbreak of cutaneous psoriasis during or after discontinuation of treatment, worsening of arthralgia, minor hypersensitivity reactions, reversible changes in laboratory values (hyperlymphocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatases and transaminases). Because of rare cases of thrombocytopenia (incidence<1/100), reversible on discontinuation of treatment, monthly monitoring of platelet counts is required over the first 3 months of therapy. There are currently no randomised studies comparing the various systemic treatments (standard therapy and biotherapy) for psoriasis. However, on extrapolation of the available results concerning efficacy (PASI-75 after 12 weeks of treatment), efalizumab appears to be less efficacious than anti-TNF alpha agents. This drug constitutes an additional treatment option and its position in the therapeutic arsenal will depend upon its long-term benefit/risk ratio in relation to other biotherapies.

17065601|t|Multiple pathways for cationic amino acid transport in rat seminiferous tubule cells.
17065601|a|Arginine and ornithine are known to be important for various biological processes in the testis, but the delivery of extracellular cationic amino acids to the seminiferous tubule cells remains poorly understood. We investigated the activity and expression of cationic amino acid transporters in isolated rat Sertoli cells, peritubular cells, pachytene spermatocytes, and early spermatids. We assessed the l-arginine uptake kinetics, Na(+) dependence of transport, profiles of cis inhibition of uptake by cationic and neutral amino acids, and sensitivity to trans stimulation of cationic amino acid transporters, and studied the expression of the genes encoding them by RT-PCR. Our data suggest that l-arginine is taken up by Sertoli cells and peritubular cells, principally via system y(+)L (SLC3A2/SLC7A6) and system y(+) (SLC7A1 and SLC7A2), with system B(0+) making a minor contribution. By contrast, system B(0+), associated with system y(+)L (SLC3A2/SLC7A7 and SLC7A6), made a major contribution to the transport of cationic amino acids in pachytene spermatocytes and early spermatids. Sertoli cells had higher rates of l-arginine transport than the other seminiferous tubule cells. This high efficiency of arginine transport in Sertoli cells and the properties of the y(+)L system predominating in these cells strongly suggest that Sertoli cells play a key role in supplying germ cells with l-arginine and other cationic amino acids. Furthermore, whereas cytokines induce nitric oxide (NO) production in peritubular and Sertoli cells, little or no upregulation of arginine transport by cytokines was observed in these cells. Thus, NO synthesis does not depend on the stimulation of arginine transport in these somatic tubular cells.

17090056|t|Transition-state structure of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.
17090056|a|Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and computer modeling using density functional theory were used to approximate the transition state of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). KIEs were measured on the arsenolysis of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) catalyzed by MTAP and were corrected for the forward commitment to catalysis. Intrinsic KIEs were obtained for [1'-(3)H], [1'-(14)C], [2'-(3)H], [4'-(3)H], [5'-(3)H(2)], [9-(15)N], and [Me-(3)H(3)] MTAs. The primary intrinsic KIEs (1'-(14)C and 9-(15)N) suggest that MTAP has a dissociative S(N)1 transition state with its cationic center at the anomeric carbon and insignificant bond order to the leaving group. The 9-(15)N intrinsic KIE of 1.039 also establishes an anionic character for the adenine leaving group, whereas the alpha-primary 1'-(14)C KIE of 1.031 indicates significant nucleophilic participation at the transition state. Computational matching of the calculated EIEs to the intrinsic isotope effects places the oxygen nucleophile 2.0 Angstrom from the anomeric carbon. The 4'-(3)H KIE is sensitive to the polarization of the 3'-OH group. Calculations suggest that a 4'-(3)H KIE of 1.047 is consistent with ionization of the 3'-OH group, indicating formation of a zwitterion at the transition state. The transition state has cationic character at the anomeric carbon and is anionic at the 3'-OH oxygen, with an anionic leaving group. The isotope effects predicted a 3'-endo conformation for the ribosyl zwitterion, corresponding to a H1'-C1'-C2'-H2' torsional angle of 33 degrees. The [Me-(3)H(3)] and [5'-(3)H(2)] KIEs arise predominantly from the negative hyperconjugation of the lone pairs of sulfur with the sigma (C-H) antibonding orbitals. Human MTAP is characterized by a late S(N)1 transition state with significant participation of the phosphate nucleophile.

17098734|t|Sequestration of retinyl esters is essential for retinoid signaling in the zebrafish embryo.
17098734|a|For vertebrate development, vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.

17100196|t|A case of Ehlers Danlos syndrome type VI.
17100196|a|Ehlers Danlos type VI is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease involving primarily the skin and joints. The main feature of the condition is neonatal hypotonia and rare complications are ruptures of arteries and the eye globe. A 4 year old girl with a typical clinical presentation and molecular diagnosis of EDS VI is presented. Sequencing of PLOD1 gene revealed a homozygous deletion in exon 13 (c.1362delC), leading to a frameshift and truncation of the lysyl hydroxylase, an enzyme necessary for collagen biosynthesis. Early diagnosis allowed treatment with high doses of ascorbic acid in order to prevent complications, genetic counseling of the family and prenatal diagnosis of an unaffected embryo.

17110146|t|Molecular modeling of purinergic receptor P2Y12 and interaction with its antagonists.
17110146|a|Purinergic receptors are a class of cell surface receptors for purines that prefer ATP or ADP over adenosine. The surface receptors for extracellular nucleotides are called P2 receptors. They are activated by both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. ADP initiates platelet aggregation by 'simultaneous activation of two G protein-coupled receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. P2Y12 has been shown to be the target of the thienopyridine drugs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel. Here, the active sites of P2Y12 for ATP as well as ADP are predicted by bioinformatics and molecular modeling. First, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of P2Y12 was constructed by InsightII/Homology module using the corresponding bovine rhodopsin (PDB code: 1HZX) as the template. Then the primary structures were optimized by energy minimization that has been successfully accepted by the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1VZ1). Second, a simple scoring matrix was built up based on the analysis of 13 known ATP-binding proteins. And the most probable active sites of P2Y12 were predicted using the scoring matrix, which include three distant areas: "head area" (LGTGPLRTFV, 87-96), "middle area" (VGLITNGLAM, 38-47, and LGAKILSVVI, 139-148), and "bottom area" (RTRGVGKVPR, 222-231). Subsequently the structural model of P2Y12 was docked with ATP/ADP in comparison with P2Y1 (PDB code 1ddd). As a comparison, we docked its antagonists, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, to the most probable sites and calculated their intermolecular energy. Our results imply that P2Y12 has the potential to be inhibited by ADP/ATP analogs, and it suggests that P2Y12 acts as a target of new drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation.

17125913|t|Cadmium induces mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cell by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.
17125913|a|Breast cancer (BC) is linked to estrogen exposure. Estradiol (E2) stimulates BC cells proliferation by binding the estrogen receptor (ER). Hormone-related cancers have been linked to estrogenic environmental contaminants. Cadmium (Cd) a toxic pollutant, acts as estrogens in BC cells. Purpose of our study was to evaluate whether Cd regulates MCF-7 cell proliferation by activating ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha kinases. Cd increased cell proliferation and the ER-antagonist ICI 182,780 blunted it. To characterize an ER-dependent mechanism, ERalpha/beta expression was evaluated. Cd decreased ERalpha expression, but not ERbeta. Cd also increased ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha phosphorylation while ICI blocked it. Since stimulation of phosphorylation was slower than expected, c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes, and PDGFA were analyzed. Cd rapidly increased c-jun, c-fos and PDGFA expression. Cells were also co-incubated with the Cd and specific kinases inhibitors, which blocked the Cd-stimulated proliferation. In conclusion, our results indicate that Cd increases BC cell proliferation in vitro by stimulating Akt, ERK1/2 and PDGFRalpha kinases activity likely by activating c-fos, c-jun and PDGFA by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.

17202804|t|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone functionally antagonizes testosterone activation of the human androgen receptor in prostate cells through focal adhesion complexes involving Hic-5.
17202804|a|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs constitute the most widely employed medical treatment for prostatic cancer. The predominant mechanism of action is presumed to be via the inhibition of gonadotropins and resultant decrease in androgen. However, GnRH analogs have also been shown to directly inhibit prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo through antiproliferative cell cycle arrest and stimulation of apoptosis. Since the GnRH receptor has been shown to affect sex steroid hormone receptor function, we considered that part of GnRH analog actions on prostate cells may be mediated through modulation of the human androgen receptor. Using a model HEK293 cell line expressing the GnRH receptor, we demonstrated a novel signalling pathway of the GnRH receptor that induces nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor that renders it transcriptionally inactive. This mechanism involves the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src and the focal adhesion protein/steroid receptor co-factor, Hic-5. In this setting there is a GnRH-induced association and nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor with Hic-5. GnRH-induced Pyk2 activation opposed the association of Hic-5 with androgen receptor as overexpression of a dominant negative Pyk2 enhanced the GnRH-induced nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein-tagged human androgen receptor. GnRH-induced c-Src activation resulted in the phosphorylation of expressed Hic-5 and promoted its association with the human androgen receptor. In contrast to testosterone, GnRH-induced nuclear translocation did not transcriptionally activate the androgen receptor. We then demonstrated that GnRH can also stimulate androgen receptor mobilization in human prostate PC3, BPH-1 and LNCaP cells, and in cultured rat ventral prostate cells through the same mechanism. To determine if GnRH could antagonize androgen effects in normal tissue, we examined the effect of GnRH on rat ventral prostate organ cultures and demonstrated that GnRH can functionally antagonize the actions of testosterone on prostate cell proliferation and tissue growth. This antagonism of testosterone action by GnRH may underlie in part the capacity of GnRH receptor activation to inhibit prostate tumor growth.

17218486|t|Trace amine-associated receptor 1 displays species-dependent stereoselectivity for isomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and para-hydroxyamphetamine.
17218486|a|The synthetic amines methamphetamine (METH), amphetamine (AMPH), and their metabolite para-hydroxyamphetamine (POHA) are chemically and structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters and a small group of endogenous biogenic amines collectively referred to as the trace amines (TAs). Recently, it was reported that METH, AMPH, POHA, and the TAs para-tyramine (TYR) and beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) stimulate cAMP production in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells expressing rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (rTAAR1). The discovery that METH and AMPH activate the rTAAR1 motivated us to study the effect of these drugs on the mouse TAAR1 (mTAAR1) and a human-rat chimera (hrChTAAR1). Furthermore, because S-(+)-isomers of METH and AMPH are reported to be more potent and efficacious in vivo than R-(-), we determined the enantiomeric selectivity of all three species of TAAR1. In response to METH, AMPH, or POHA exposure, the accumulation of cAMP by HEK-293 cells stably expressing different species of TAAR1 was concentration- and isomer-dependent. EC50 values for S-(+)-METH were 0.89, 0.92, and 4.44 microM for rTAAR1, mTAAR1, and h-rChTAAR1, respectively. PEA was a potent and full agonist at each species of TAAR1, whereas TYR was a full agonist for the rodent TAAR1s but was a partial agonist at h-rChTAAR1. Interestingly, both isomers of METH were full agonists at mTAAR1 and h-rChTAAR1, whereas both were partial agonists at rTAAR1. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, TAAR1 could be a novel mediator of the effects of these drugs.

17221210|t|Regulation of pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation by sulphated proteoglycans.
17221210|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Epithelium-mesenchyme interactions play a major role in pancreas development. Recently, we demonstrated that embryonic pancreatic mesenchyme enhanced progenitor cell proliferation but inhibited endocrine cell differentiation. Here, we investigated the role played by sulphated proteoglycans, which are known to be essential to embryonic development, in this inhibitory effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first determined the expression of the genes encoding glypicans, syndecans and the main glycosaminoglycan chain-modifying enzymes in immature embryonic day (E) 13.5 and more differentiated E17.5 rat pancreases. Next, using an in vitro model of pancreas development, we blocked the action of endogenous sulphated proteoglycans by treating embryonic pancreases in culture with chlorate, an inhibitor of proteoglycan sulphation, and examined the effects on pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. RESULTS: We first showed that expression of the genes encoding glypicans 1, 2, 3 and 5 and heparan sulphate 2-sulfotransferase decreased between E13.5 and E17.5. We next found that alteration of proteoglycan action by chlorate blocked the inhibitory effect of the mesenchyme on endocrine differentiation. Chlorate-treated pancreases exhibited a dramatic increase in beta cell number in a dose-dependent manner (169-and 375-fold increase with 30 mmol/l and 40 mmol/l chlorate, respectively) and in alpha cell development. Insulin-positive cells that developed in the presence of chlorate exhibited a phenotype of mature cells with regard to the expression of the following genes: pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (Pdx1), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (Pcsk1; previously known as pro-hormone convertase 1/3), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (Pcsk2; previously known as pro-hormone convertase 2) and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 2 (Slc2a1; previously known as glucose transporter 2). Finally, we showed that chlorate activated endocrine cell development by inducing neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) expression in early endocrine progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that sulphated proteoglycans control pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. Understanding the mechanism by which sulphated proteoglycans affect beta cell development could be useful in the generation of beta cells from embryonic stem cells.

17228881|t|Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. DNA cloning, characterization, and inhibition studies of the human secretory isoform VI, a new target for sulfonamide and sulfamate inhibitors.
17228881|a|The secretory isozyme of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1), hCA VI, has been cloned, expressed, and purified in a bacterial expression system. The kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction proved hCA VI to possess a kcat of 3.4 x 10(5) s-1 and kcat/KM of 4.9 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 (at pH 7.5 and 20 degrees C). hCA VI has a significant catalytic activity for the physiological reaction on the same order of magnitude as the ubiquitous isoform CA I or the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme CA IX. A series of sulfonamides and one sulfamate have been tested for their interaction with this isozyme. Simple benzenesulfonamides were rather ineffective hCA VI inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 1090-6680 nM. Better inhibitors were detected among such derivatives bearing 2- or 4-amino-, 4-aminomethyl-, or 4-hydroxymethyl moieties or among halogenated sulfanilamides (KI values of 608-955 nM). Some clinically used compounds, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, topiramate, sulpiride, and indisulam, or the orphan drug benzolamide, showed effective hCA VI inhibitory activity, with inhibition constants of 0.8-79 nM. The best inhibitors were brinzolamide and sulpiride (KI values of 0.8-0.9 nM), the latter compound being also a CA VI-selective inhibitor. The metallic taste reported as a side effect after the treatment with systemic sulfonamides may be due to the inhibition of the salivary CA VI. Some of the compounds investigated in this study might be used as additives in toothpastes for reducing the acidification produced by the relevant CO2 hydrase activity of enamel CA VI, which leads to the formation of protons and bicarbonate and may have a role in cariogenesis.

17229090|t|Role of the calcium modulated cyclases in the development of the retinal projections.
17229090|a|Transmembrane isoforms of adenylate cyclases (AC) integrate a wide variety of extracellular signals from neurotransmitters to morphogens and can also regulate cAMP production in response to calcium entry. Based on observations in the barrelless mouse strain, the Adcy1 gene (AC1) was involved in the segregation of binocular retinal inputs. To determine the potential role of other AC isoforms we localized the Adcy genes in the visual centres during development, using in situ hybridization. Six different AC subtypes were found in the developing retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC; AC1, AC2, AC3, AC5, AC8, and AC9), and three AC subtypes were expressed in the central brain targets, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (AC1 and AC8), the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (AC2 and AC8) and the superior colliculus (AC1, AC2, AC8). Using a genetic approach we tested the role of the calcium modulated cyclases AC1, AC5 and AC8 for the segregation retinal fibres. Ipsilateral retinal axons remained exuberant in the AC1(-/-) mice, with overlapping retinal projections from both eyes in the superior colliculus and the visual thalamus. These abnormalities were similar to those of barrelless mouse mutants. No abnormalities were detectable in the AC5(-/-) or the AC8(-/-) mice. Similar abnormalities were noted in the single AC1(-/-) and the AC1/AC8 double-knockout mice (DKO). Thus, only AC1 is required for the maturation of the retinal axon terminals whereas AC5 and AC8 are not needed. The specificity of AC1's action is linked to its cellular localization in the RGCs and to its distinctive functional profile, compared with the other cyclases expressed in the same cells.

17234158|t|Pirfenidone inhibits TGF-beta expression in malignant glioma cells.
17234158|a|Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.

17256745|t|Human and rat bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase are liver-specific peroxisomal enzymes: implications for intracellular bile salt transport.
17256745|a|UNLABELLED: Bile acid-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) is the sole enzyme responsible for conjugation of primary and secondary bile acids to taurine and glycine. Previous studies indicate a peroxisomal location of BAAT in peroxisomes with variable amounts up to 95% detected in cytosolic fractions. The absence or presence of a cytosolic pool of BAAT has important implications for the intracellular transport of unconjugated/deconjugated bile salts. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and digitonin permeabilization assays to determine the subcellular location of endogenous BAAT in primary human and rat hepatocytes. In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat Baat (rBaat) and human BAAT (hBAAT) were transiently expressed in primary rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts. Catalase and recombinant GFP-SKL and DsRed-SKL were used as peroxisomal markers. Endogenous hBAAT and rBaat were found to specifically localize to peroxisomes in human and rat hepatocytes, respectively. No significant cytosolic fraction was detected for either protein. GFP-tagged hBAAT and rBaat were efficiently sorted to peroxisomes of primary rat hepatocytes. Significant amounts of GFP-tagged hBAAT or rBaat were detected in the cytosol only when coexpressed with DsRed-SKL, suggesting that hBAAT/rBaat and DsRed-SKL compete for the same peroxisomal import machinery. When expressed in fibroblasts, GFP-tagged hBAAT localized to the cytosol, confirming earlier observations. CONCLUSION: hBAAT and rBaat are peroxisomal enzymes present in undetectable amounts in the cytosol. Unconjugated or deconjugated bile salts returning to the liver need to shuttle through the peroxisome before reentering the enterohepatic circulation.

17290783|t|[Construction of the flavinogenic yeast Candida famata strains with high riboflavin kinase activity using gene engineering].
17290783|a|The recombinant strains of the flavinogenic yeast Candida famata, which contain the DNA fragment consisting of the FMN1 gene (encoding the riboflavin kinase, enzyme that converts riboflavin to flavinmononucleotide) driven by the strong promoters (the regulated RIB1 or constitutive TEF1 promoter) were isolated. Riboflavin kinase activity in the isolated transformants was tested. The 6-8-fold increase of the riboflavin kinase activity was shown in the recombinant strains containing the integrated Debaryomyces hansenii FMN1 gene under the strong constitutive TEF1 promoter. The recombinant strains can be used for the following construction of flavinmononucleotide overproducers.

17303537|t|The impact of thyroid activity variations on some oxidizing-stress parameters in rats.
17303537|a|The effect of the thyroid activity on the formation of lipid peroxidation and on liver and heart antioxidant enzyme activities was investigated in Wistar rats. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism conditions were induced for five weeks by the administration of 0.05% benzythiouracile (BTU) and L-thyroxine sodium salt (0.0012%), in drinking water, respectively. No significant effect was observed on the rates of both lipid peroxidation and the vitamin E in hepatic and cardiac tissues of hypothyroidism rats compared to the controls, contrary to the hyperthyroidism rats, which expressed a pronounced increase. The increased glutathione peroxidase activity in rats suffering from hyperthyroidism was associated with a fall of the reduced glutathione in the homogenate and a marked increase in the glutathione reductase activity. An increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities was also recorded in hyperthyroidism. Our results explain the thyroid activity variation in relation to the lipid peroxidation and the tissular contents of the enzymatic and the non-enzymatic antioxidants. To conclude, our results show the occurrence of a state of oxidizing stress in relation to hyperthyroidism.

1730582|t|Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Characterization of sequences at the inhibitor and coenzyme binding sites.
1730582|a|Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant enzyme used for determination of the binding site for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and of the residues modified in the inactivation of the enzyme by the enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in mouse ODC was identified as lysine 69 of the mouse sequence by reduction of the purified holoenzyme form with NaB[3H]4 followed by digestion of the carboxymethylated protein with endoproteinase Lys-C, radioactive peptide mapping using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gas-phase peptide sequencing. This lysine is contained in the sequence PFYAVKC, which is found in all known ODCs from eukaryotes. The preceding amino acids do not conform to the consensus sequence of SXHK, which contains the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in a number of other decarboxylases including ODCs from E. coli. Using a similar procedure to analyze ODC labeled by reaction with [5-14C]DFMO, it was found that lysine 69 and cysteine 360 formed covalent adducts with the inhibitor. Cysteine 360, which was the major adduct accounting for about 90% of the total labeling, is contained within the sequence -WGPTCDGL(I)D-, which is present in all known eukaryote ODCs. These results provide strong evidence that these two peptides form essential parts of the catalytic site of ODC. Analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides containing the DFMO-cysteine adduct indicated that the adduct formed in the enzyme was probably the cyclic imine S-(2-(1-pyrroline)methyl)cysteine. This is readily oxidized to S-((2-pyrrole)methyl)cysteine or converted to S-((2-pyrrolidine)methyl)cysteine by NaBH4 reduction. This adduct is consistent with spectral evidence showing that inactivation of the enzyme with DFMO does not entail the formation of a stable adduct between the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the enzyme, and the inhibitor.

17311416|t|Pre-steady-state currents in neutral amino acid transporters induced by photolysis of a new caged alanine derivative.
17311416|a|Na+-Dependent transmembrane transport of small neutral amino acids, such as glutamine and alanine, is mediated, among others, by the neutral amino acid transporters of the solute carrier 1 [SLC1, alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2] and SLC38 families [sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1), SNAT2, and SNAT4]. Many mechanistic aspects of amino acid transport by these systems are not well-understood. Here, we describe a new photolabile alanine derivative based on protection of alanine with the 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI) caging group, which we use for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of alanine transport by ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2. MNI-alanine has favorable photochemical properties and is stable in aqueous solution. It is also inert with respect to the transport systems studied. Photolytic release of free alanine results in the generation of significant transient current components in HEK293 cells expressing the ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 proteins. In ASCT2, these currents show biphasic decay with time constants, tau, in the 1-30 ms time range. They are fully inhibited in the absence of extracellular Na+, demonstrating that Na+ binding to the transporter is necessary for induction of the alanine-mediated current. For SNAT1, these transient currents differ in their time course (tau = 1.6 ms) from previously described pre-steady-state currents generated by applying steps in the membrane potential (tau approximately 4-5 ms), indicating that they are associated with a fast, previously undetected, electrogenic partial reaction in the SNAT1 transport cycle. The implications of these results for the mechanisms of transmembrane transport of alanine are discussed. The new caged alanine derivative will provide a useful tool for future, more detailed studies of neutral amino acid transport.

17315258|t|Histochemical staining and quantification of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase diaphorase activity using blue native PAGE.
17315258|a|Mammalian mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH, EC 1.8.1.4) catalyzes NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of dihydrolipoamide in vivo and can also act as a diaphorase catalyzing in vitro nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) (NADH)-dependent reduction of electron-accepting molecules such as ubiquinone and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). In this paper, we report a gel-based method for histochemical staining and quantification of DLDH diaphorase activity using blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE). Rat brain mitochondrial extracts, used as the source of DLDH, were resolved by nongradient BN-PAGE (9%), which was followed by diaphorase activity staining using NADH as the electron donor and NBT as the electron acceptor. It was shown that activity staining of DLDH diaphorase was both protein amount- and time-dependent. Moreover, this in-gel activity-staining method was demonstrated to be in good agreement with the conventional spectrophotometric method that measures DLDH dehydrogenase activity using dihydrolipoamide as the substrate. The method was applied to determine levels of DLDH diaphorase activity in several rat tissues other than the brain, and the results indicated a similar level of DLDH diaphorase activity for all the tissues examined. Finally, the effects of thiol-reactive reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and nitric oxide donors on DLDH diaphorase activity were evaluated, demonstrating that, with this method, DLDH diaphorase activity can be determined without having to remove these thiol-reactive reagents that may otherwise interfere with spectrophotometric measurement of DLDH dehydrogenase activity. The gel-based method can also be used as a means to isolate mitochondrial DLDH that is to be analyzed by mass spectral techniques in studying DLDH post-translational modifications.

17319904|t|Reticulated platelets and uninhibited COX-1 and COX-2 decrease the antiplatelet effects of aspirin.
17319904|a|BACKGROUND: The mechanisms for the variability in antiplatelet effects of aspirin are unclear. Immature (reticulated) platelets may modulate the antiplatelet effects of aspirin through uninhibited cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of reticulated platelets in the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. METHODS: Sixty healthy volunteers had platelet studies performed before and 24 h after a single 325-mg dose of aspirin. Platelet studies included light transmission aggregometry; P-selectin and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) expression, and serum thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) levels. Reticulated platelets and platelet COX-2 expression were measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Subjects were divided into tertiles based on the percentage of reticulated platelets in whole blood. Baseline platelet aggregation to 1 microg mL(-1) collagen, and postaspirin aggregations to 5 microm and 20 microm ADP and collagen, were greater in the upper than in the lower tertile of reticulated platelets. Stimulated P-selectin and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) expression were also higher in the upper tertile both before and after aspirin. Platelet COX-2 expression was detected in 12 +/- 7% (n = 10) of platelets in the upper tertile, and in 7 +/- 3% (n = 12) of platelets in the lower two tertiles (P = 0.03). Postaspirin serum TxB(2) levels were higher in the upper (5.5 +/- 4 ng mL(-1)) than in the lower tertile (3.2 +/- 2.5 ng mL(-1), P = 0.03), and decreased even further with ex vivo additional COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. The incidence of aspirin resistance (>or= 70% platelet aggregation to 5 microm ADP) was significantly higher in the upper tertile (45%) than in the lower tertile (5%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Reticulated platelets are associated with diminished antiplatelet effects of aspirin and increased aspirin resistance, possibly because of increased reactivity, and uninhibited COX-1 and COX-2 activity.

17320868|t|Neuroprotection by estrogen against MPP+-induced dopamine neuron death is mediated by ERalpha in primary cultures of mouse mesencephalon.
17320868|a|Estrogen involvement in neuroprotection is now widely accepted, although the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of estrogen action in neuroprotection remain unclear. This study examines estrogenic effects in a mixed population of cells in attempts to identify the contributing cells that result in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. Utilizing primary mesencephalic neurons, we found expression of both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) with a predominance of ERalpha on both dopamine neurons and astrocytes. We also found that 17beta-estradiol protects dopamine neurons from injury induced by the complex I inhibitor, 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)) in a time- and ER-dependent manner. At least 4 h of estrogen pre-treatment was required to elicit protection, an effect that was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. Moreover, ERalpha mediated the protection afforded by estrogen since only the ERalpha agonist, HPTE, but not the ERbeta agonist, DPN, protected against dopamine cell loss. Since glial cells were shown to express significant levels of ERalpha, we investigated a possible indirect mechanism of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection through glial cell interaction. Removal of glial cells from the cultures by application of the mitotic inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, significantly reduced the neuroprotective effects of estrogen. These data indicate that neuroprotection provided by estrogen against MPP(+) toxicity is mediated by ERalpha and involves an interplay among at least two cell types.

17324065|t|Differential activation of cAMP response element binding protein in discrete nucleus accumbens subregions during early and late cocaine sensitization.
17324065|a|The present study examined the differential cocaine-induced activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) throughout discrete zones of analysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rats. CREB-dependent gene transcription, which may underlie long-lasting drug-induced changes in behavior and the subjective effects of cocaine, varies depending on the stage of drug exposure or withdrawal and the cell population involved. Using immunohistochemistry, the authors analyzed changes in CREB phosphorylation in the NAc after 5 days of cocaine, a short or long drug-free period, and a subsequent challenge injection. The NAc shell was separated into 5 zones of analysis previously defined by neurochemistry and connectivity. Repeated cocaine resulted in CREB phosphorylation in all analyzed subregions of the NAc excluding the most ventrolateral region of the shell 2 weeks after cessation of repeated cocaine, but rats challenged after 2 drug-free days yielded a more localized activation of CREB in the 3 most dorsomedial zones of the shell. The temporal and anatomical determinants of cocaine-induced CREB activity may indicate functional differences among NAc shell subregions and suggest the involvement of CREB in early and late cocaine effects.

17327402|a|The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.

17333241|t|Levels of 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) and effect modification of polymorphisms of glutathione-related genes in vulcanization workers in the southern Sweden rubber industries.
17333241|a|OBJECTIVES: Workers in the rubber industry are exposed to a complex mixture of hazardous substances and have increased risk of developing several diseases. However, there is no up to date survey examining the exposure in the Swedish rubber industry. One of the toxic compounds in the industry is carbon disulfide (CS(2)), which is biotransformed to 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA). TTCA is used as a biomarker of CS(2) exposure, but there seem to exist inter- and intraindividual variability; which could partly be due to genetic variation. The aim of the study was to determine TTCA levels and the modifying effects of glutathione-related genes in a group of Swedish rubber workers. METHODS: Urine was collected from both exposed workers and controls during the last 4 h of the work shift. The level of TTCA in urine was analyzed by liquid chromatograpy tandem mass spectrometry. Genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphisms GCLC-129, GCLM-588, GSTA1-52, GSTP1-105 and GSTP1-114 and deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were performed with real-time PCR or ordinary PCR and subsequent agarose electrophoresis. RESULTS: The highest levels of TTCA were found among workers curing with salt bath, hot air, microwaves or fluid-bed, and lower levels were found among workers curing with injection and compression molding. Furthermore, with respect to GSTM1 and GSTT1 there were statistically significant differences in TTCA-levels between genotypes among exposed workers but not among controls. The other five polymorphisms had no impact on the TTCA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates relatively high levels of TTCA in urine from Swedish rubber workers. Polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 modify the levels.

17334413|t|H3 histamine receptor agonist inhibits biliary growth of BDL rats by downregulation of the cAMP-dependent PKA/ERK1/2/ELK-1 pathway.
17334413|a|Histamine regulates many functions by binding to four histamine G-coupled receptor proteins (H1R, H2R, H3R and H4R). As H3R exerts their effects by coupling to Galpha(i/o) proteins reducing adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels (a key player in the modulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia/damage), we evaluated the role of H3R in the regulation of biliary growth. We posed the following questions: (1) Do cholangiocytes express H3R? (2) Does in vivo administration of (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH) (H3R agonist), thioperamide maleate (H3R antagonist) or histamine, in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate, to bile duct ligated (BDL) rats regulate cholangiocyte proliferation? and (3) Does RAMH inhibit cholangiocyte proliferation by downregulation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/ets-like gene-1 (Elk-1)? The expression of H3R was evaluated in liver sections by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and by real-time PCR in cholangiocyte RNA from normal and BDL rats. BDL rats (immediately after BDL) were treated daily with RAMH, thioperamide maleate or histamine in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate for 1 week. Following in vivo treatment of BDL rats with RAMH for 1 week, and in vitro stimulation of BDL cholangiocytes with RAMH, we evaluated cholangiocyte proliferation, cAMP levels and PKA, ERK1/2 and Elk-1 phosphorylation. Cholangiocytes from normal and BDL rats express H3R. The expression of H3R mRNA increased in BDL compared to normal cholangiocytes. Histamine decreased cholangiocyte growth of BDL rats to a lower extent than that observed in BDL RAMH-treated rats; histamine-induced inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was partly blocked by thioperamide maleate. In BDL rats treated with thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte hyperplasia was slightly higher than that of BDL rats. In vitro, RAMH inhibited the proliferation of BDL cholangiocytes. RAMH inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was associated with decreased cAMP levels and PKA/ERK1/2/Elk-1 phosphorylation. Downregulation of cAMP-dependent PKA/ERK1/2/Elk-1 phosphorylation (by activation of H3R) is important in the inhibition of cholangiocyte growth in liver diseases.

17344208|t|Structure and kinetics of monofunctional proline dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus.
17344208|a|Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) catalyze the two-step oxidation of proline to glutamate. They are distinct monofunctional enzymes in all eukaryotes and some bacteria but are fused into bifunctional enzymes known as proline utilization A (PutA) in other bacteria. Here we report the first structure and biochemical data for a monofunctional PRODH. The 2.0-A resolution structure of Thermus thermophilus PRODH reveals a distorted (betaalpha)(8) barrel catalytic core domain and a hydrophobic alpha-helical domain located above the carboxyl-terminal ends of the strands of the barrel. Although the catalytic core is similar to that of the PutA PRODH domain, the FAD conformation of T. thermophilus PRODH is remarkably different and likely reflects unique requirements for membrane association and communication with P5CDH. Also, the FAD of T. thermophilus PRODH is highly solvent-exposed compared with PutA due to a 4-A shift of helix 8. Structure-based sequence analysis of the PutA/PRODH family led us to identify nine conserved motifs involved in cofactor and substrate recognition. Biochemical studies show that the midpoint potential of the FAD is -75 mV and the kinetic parameters for proline are K(m) = 27 mm and k(cat) = 13 s(-1). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline was found to be an efficient substrate, and l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid is a competitive inhibitor (K(I) = 1.0 mm). Finally, we demonstrate that T. thermophilus PRODH reacts with O(2) producing superoxide. This is significant because superoxide production underlies the role of human PRODH in p53-mediated apoptosis, implying commonalities between eukaryotic and bacterial monofunctional PRODHs.

17347380|t|Creatine uptake in brain and skeletal muscle of mice lacking guanidinoacetate methyltransferase assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
17347380|a|Creatine (Cr) levels in skeletal muscle and brain of a mouse model of Cr deficiency caused by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase absence (GAMT-/-) were studied after Cr supplementation with 2 g.kg body wt-1.day-1 Cr for 35 days. Localized 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed in brain (cerebellum and thalamus/hippocampus) and in hind leg muscle of GAMT-/- mice before and after Cr supplementation and in control (Con) mice. As expected, a signal for Cr was hardly detectable in MR spectra of GAMT-/- mice before Cr supplementation. In the thalamus/hippocampus region of these mice, an increase in N-acetylasparate (NAA) was observed. During Cr administration, Cr levels increased faster in skeletal muscle compared with brain, but this occurred only during the first day of supplementation. Thereafter, Cr levels increased by 0.8 mM/day in all studied locations. After 35 days of Cr supplementation, Cr levels in all locations were higher compared with Con mice on a Cr-free diet and NAA levels normalized. Only because of the repeated MRS measurements performed in this longitudinal Cr supplementation study on GAMT-/- mice were we able to discover the initial faster uptake of Cr in skeletal muscle compared with brain, which may represent muscular Cr uptake independent of Cr transporter expression. Our results can provide the basis for additional experiments to optimize Cr supplementation in GAMT deficiency, as increases in brain Cr are slow in patients after Cr supplementation.

17352685|t|Highly selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors for the treatment of allergic skin diseases and psoriasis.
17352685|a|The phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 is the predominant cyclic AMP degrading enzyme in a variety of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and monocytes. In addition, this enzyme is expressed in non-immune cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Highly selective PDE4 inhibitors are currently under evaluation for the treatment of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to the broad anti-inflammatory/immuno-modulatory action of PDE4 inhibitors, it has been proposed that PDE4 inhibitors might also be efficacious for skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Consequently, PDE4 inhibitors including cilomilast and AWD 12-281 have been tested in several models of allergic and irritant skin inflammation. These PDE4 inhibitors displayed strong anti-inflammatory action in models of allergic contact dermatitis in mice, in the arachidonic acid induced skin inflammation in mice and in ovalbumin sensitised guinea pigs. The determination of cytokines in skin homogenates revealed that both Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines are suppressed by PDE4 inhibitors, indicating an anti-inflammatory activity in both the Th2 dominated acute phase as well as the Th1 dominated chronic phase of atopic dermatitis. Due to the suppression of Th1 cytokines, activity can also be expected in psoriasis. Results of early clinical trials with both topically (cipamfylline, CP80,633) and systemically (CC-10004) active PDE4 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis and in the case of CC-10004, also in psoriasis. AWD 12-281 (GW 842470) is currently under clinical evaluation for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. Results concerning clinical efficacy of this potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor are anxiously awaited.

17354225|t|Aberrant regulation of argininosuccinate synthetase by TNF-alpha in human epithelial ovarian cancer.
17354225|a|The pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha, is dysregulated in malignant compared with normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). Several epidemiological studies have associated inflammation with ovarian tumorigenesis, with TNF-alpha playing a key role in modulating invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Here, we show that TNF-alpha also induces expression of arate-limiting enzyme in arginine synthesis, argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), thereby linking inflammation with several arginine-dependent metabolic pathways, implicated in accelerated carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Having identified AS mRNA induction in TNF-alpha-treated IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells, using RNA-arbitrarily primed-PCR, we then observed differential regulation of AS mRNA and protein in malignant, compared with normal, OSE cells. A cDNA cancer profiling array with matched normal ovarian and ovarian tumour samples revealed increased expression of AS mRNA in the latter. Moreover, AS protein co-localised with TNF-alpha in ovarian cancer cells, with significantly higher levels of AS in malignant compared with normal ovarian tissue. Increased co-expression of AS and TNF-alpha mRNA was also observed in 2 other epithelial tumours, non-small cell lung and stomach cancer, compared with normal corresponding tissues. In summary, high levels of AS expression, which may be required for several arginine-dependent processes in cancer, including the production of nitric oxide, proline, pyrimidines and polyamines, is regulated by TNF-alpha and may provide an important molecular pathway linking inflammation and metabolism to ovarian tumorigenesis.

17367165|t|Mechanism of specific membrane targeting by C2 domains: localized pools of target lipids enhance Ca2+ affinity.
17367165|a|The C2 domain is a ubiquitous, conserved protein signaling motif widely found in eukaryotic signaling proteins. Although considerable functional diversity exists, most C2 domains are activated by Ca2+ binding and then dock to a specific cellular membrane. The C2 domains of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) and cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha), for example, are known to dock to different membrane surfaces during an intracellular Ca2+ signal. Ca2+ activation targets the PKCalpha C2 domain to the plasma membrane and the cPLA2alpha C2 domain to the internal membranes, with no detectable spatial overlap. It is crucial to determine how such targeting specificity is achieved at physiological bulk Ca2+ concentrations that during a typical signaling event rarely exceed 1 muM. For the isolated PKCalpha C2 domain in the presence of physiological Ca2+ levels, the target lipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are together sufficient to recruit the PKCalpha C2 domain to a lipid mixture mimicking the plasma membrane inner leaflet. For the cPLA2alpha C2 domain, the target lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) appears to be sufficient to drive membrane targeting to an internal membrane mimic at physiological Ca2+ levels, although the results do not rule out a second, unknown target molecule. Stopped-flow kinetic studies provide additional information about the fundamental molecular events that occur during Ca2+-activated membrane docking. In principle, C2 domain-directed intracellular targeting, which requires coincidence detection of multiple signals (Ca2+ and one or more target lipids), can exhibit two different mechanisms: messenger-activated target affinity (MATA) and target-activated messenger affinity (TAMA). The C2 domains studied here both utilize the TAMA mechanism, in which the C2 domain Ca2+ affinity is too low to be activated by physiological Ca2+ signals in most regions of the cell. Only when the C2 domain nears its target membrane, which provides a high local concentration of target lipid, is the effective Ca2+ affinity increased by the coupled binding equilibrium to a level that enables substantial Ca2+ activation and target docking. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of using physiological ligand concentrations in targeting studies because super-physiological concentrations can drive docking interactions even when an important targeting molecule is missing.

17379925|t|Quantification and regulation of the subcellular distribution of bile acid coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity in rat liver.
17379925|a|Bile acid coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) is responsible for the amidation of bile acids with the amino acids glycine and taurine. To quantify total BAT activity in liver subcellular organelles, livers from young adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were fractionated into multiple subcellular compartments. In male and female rats, 65-75% of total liver BAT activity was found in the cytosol, 15-17% was found in the peroxisomes, and 5-10% was found in the heavy mitochondrial fraction. After clofibrate treatment, male rats displayed an increase in peroxisomal BAT specific activity and a decrease in cytosolic BAT specific activity, whereas females showed an opposite response. However, there was no overall change in BAT specific activity in whole liver homogenate. Treatment with rosiglitazone or cholestyramine had no effect on BAT activity in any subcellular compartment. These experiments indicate that the majority of BAT activity in the rat liver resides in the cytosol. Approximately 15% of BAT activity is present in the peroxisomal matrix. These data support the novel finding that clofibrate treatment does not directly regulate BAT activity but does alter the subcellular localization of BAT.

17380207|t|Mesenchymal cells regulate the response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to asparaginase.
17380207|a|Because of their low asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression and asparagine biosynthesis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are exquisitely sensitive to asparagine depletion. Consequently, asparaginase is a major component of ALL therapy, but the mechanisms regulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to this agent are unclear. In 288 children with ALL, cellular ASNS expression was more likely to be high in T-lineage ALL and low in B-lineage ALL with TEL-AML1 or hyperdiploidy. However, ASNS expression levels in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs), which form the microenvironment where leukemic cells grow, were on average 20 times higher than those in ALL cells. MSCs protected ALL cells from asparaginase cytotoxicity in coculture experiments. This protective effect correlated with levels of ASNS expression: downregulation by RNA interference decreased the capacity of MSCs to protect ALL cells from asparaginase, whereas enforced ASNS expression conferred enhanced protection. Asparagine secretion by MSCs was directly related to their ASNS expression levels, suggesting a mechanism - increased concentrations of asparagine in the leukemic cell microenvironment - for the protective effects we observed. These results provide what we believe to be a new basis for understanding asparaginase resistance in ALL and indicate that MSC niches in the bone marrow can form a safe haven for leukemic cells.

17403555|t|Toxicity of beta-amyloid in HEK293 cells expressing NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits.
17403555|a|Neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) involves glutamate toxicity, resulting from overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and elevation of intracellular calcium. However, the heterogeneity of the NMDA receptors, frequently composed of NR1 and NR2A-D subunits, has been less studied. Thus, we determined the contribution of NMDA receptor subtypes on Abeta(1-40) toxicity in HEK293 cells transiently expressing NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B subunits. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and trypan blue exclusion revealed an increase in Abeta(1-40) toxicity upon NR1/NR2A expression, compared to NR1/NR2B, indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity. Furthermore, Abeta(1-40) decreased intracellular ATP in cells expressing NR1/NR2A. MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, partially prevented the decrease in cell viability and the energy impairment. These differences were not accounted for by the activation of caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9 or calpains or by DNA fragmentation, excluding the hypothesis of apoptosis. Functional NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptor subtypes were further evidenced by single-cell calcium imaging. Stimulation of NR1/NR2A receptors with NMDA/glycine revealed an increase in intracellular calcium in cells pre-exposed to Abeta(1-40). Opposite effects were observed upon activation of NR1/NR2B receptors. These results suggest that NR1/NR2A-composed NMDA receptors mediate necrotic cell death in HEK293 cells exposed to Abeta(1-40) through changes in calcium homeostasis.

17409318|t|Competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for Delta 6 desaturase may limit the accumulation of DHA in HepG2 cell membranes.
17409318|a|The use of Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) twice in the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) suggests that this enzyme may play a key regulatory role in the synthesis and accumulation of DHA from ALA. We examined this using an in vitro model of fatty acid metabolism to measure the accumulation of the long-chain metabolites of ALA in HepG2 cell phospholipids. The accumulation of ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), and 24:5n-3 in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration of supplemented ALA over the range tested (1.8-72 microM). The accumulation of the post-D6D products of 22:5n-3, 24:6n-3 and DHA, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of >18 microM ALA. Supplementation of HepG2 cells with preformed DHA revealed that, although the accumulation of DHA in cell phospholipids approached saturation, the level of DHA in cell phospholipids was significantly greater compared with the accumulation of DHA from ALA, indicating that the accumulation of DHA from ALA was not limited by incorporation. The parallel pattern of accumulation of 24:6n-3 and DHA in response to increasing concentrations of ALA suggests that the competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for D6D may contribute to the limited accumulation of DHA in cell membranes.

17413769|t|Plasma S/R ratio of warfarin co-varies with VKORC1 haplotype.
17413769|a|We recently reported that the low-dose VKORC1*2 haplotype is an important genetic determinant for warfarin dose requirement and is associated with difficulties to attain stable therapeutic prothrombin time--International Normalized Ratio in patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with VKORC1*2 compared with patients carrying high-dose haplotypes VKORC1*3 or VKORC1*4 had different warfarin S/R ratios in their plasma, and whether that was related to CYP2C9 variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 or other factors. Samples from patients previously haplotyped for VKORC1 and measured for plasma warfarin concentration were genotyped for the CYP2C9 variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to elucidate whether there was any significant difference in the warfarin S/R ratio between the two patient groups. Our result shows that there is a significant difference (P<0.01) in warfarin S/R ratios between VKORC1*2 and VKORC1*3 or VKORC1*4 patients. This difference did not originate from CYP2C9 variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. We speculate that VKORC1 haplotypes possibly are linked to some unidentified factors involved in the metabolic clearance of warfarin enantiomers. Dose-dependent variations in (S)-warfarin and (R)-warfarin clearance in these patients can also be a probable explanation for the difference in warfarin S/R ratios.

17468175|t|Dopamine D1 receptor agonist and D2 receptor antagonist effects of the natural product (-)-stepholidine: molecular modeling and dynamics simulations.
17468175|a|(-)-Stepholidine (SPD), an active ingredient of the Chinese herb Stephania, is the first compound found to have dual function as a dopamine receptor D1 agonist and D2 antagonist. Insights into dynamical behaviors of D1 and D2 receptors and their interaction modes with SPD are crucial in understanding the structural and functional characteristics of dopamine receptors. In this study a computational approach, integrating protein structure prediction, automated molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the dual action mechanism of SPD on the D1 and D2 receptors, with the eventual aim to develop new drugs for treating diseases affecting the central nervous system such as schizophrenia. The dynamics simulations revealed the surface features of the electrostatic potentials and the conformational "open-closed" process of the binding entrances of two dopamine receptors. Potential binding conformations of D1 and D2 receptors were obtained, and the D1-SPD and D2-SPD complexes were generated, which are in good agreement with most of experimental data. The D1-SPD structure shows that the K-167_EL-2-E-302_EL-3 (EL-2: extracellular loop 2; EL-3: extracellular loop 3) salt bridge plays an important role for both the conformational change of the extracellular domain and the binding of SPD. Based on our modeling and simulations, we proposed a mechanism of the dual action of SPD and a subsequent signal transduction model. Further mutagenesis and biophysical experiments are needed to test and improve our proposed dual action mechanism of SPD and signal transduction model.

17475961|t|GLP-1 receptor expression in human tumors and human normal tissues: potential for in vivo targeting.
17475961|a|UNLABELLED: Peptide hormone receptors overexpressed in human tumors, such as somatostatin receptors, can be used for in vivo targeting for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A novel promising candidate in this field is the GLP-1 receptor, which was recently shown to be massively overexpressed in gut and lung neuroendocrine tumors--in particular, in insulinomas. Anticipating a major development of GLP-1 receptor targeting in nuclear medicine, our aim was to evaluate in vitro the GLP-1 receptor expression in a large variety of other tumors and to compare it with that in nonneoplastic tissues. METHODS: The GLP-1 receptor protein expression was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated in a broad spectrum of human tumors (n=419) and nonneoplastic human tissues (n=209) with receptor autoradiography using (125)I-GLP-1(7-36)amide. Pharmacologic competition experiments were performed to provide proof of specificity of the procedure. RESULTS: GLP-1 receptors were expressed in various endocrine tumors, with particularly high amounts in pheochromocytomas, as well as in brain tumors and embryonic tumors but not in carcinomas or lymphomas. In nonneoplastic tissues, GLP-1 receptors were present in generally low amounts in specific tissue compartments of several organs--namely, pancreas, intestine, lung, kidney, breast, and brain; no receptors were identified in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or the adrenal gland. The rank order of potencies for receptor binding--namely, GLP-1(7-36)amide = exendin-4 >> GLP-2 = glucagon(1-29)--provided proof of specific GLP-1 receptor identification. CONCLUSION: The GLP-1 receptors may represent a novel molecular target for in vivo scintigraphy and targeted radiotherapy for a variety of GLP-1 receptor-expressing tumors. For GLP-1 receptor scintigraphy, a low-background signal can be expected, on the basis of the low receptor expression in the normal tissues surrounding tumors.

17496727|t|A novel variant L263F in human inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 is associated with diminished enzyme activity.
17496727|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 is required for purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. Variants in the IMPDH2 gene may account for the large inter-individual variability in baseline enzyme activity, immunosuppressive efficacy and side effects in transplant recipients receiving mycophenolic acid. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and functionally characterize IMPDH2 variants. METHODS: DNA samples from 152 solid organ transplant patients were screened at exons and exon/intron junctions of the IMPDH2 genes by PCR amplification followed by bidirectional direct DNA sequencing. Genetic variant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and transformed to an inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli h712. Proteins were purified to homogeneity and the enzymatic activity was measured by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide production. RESULTS: Nine genetic variants were identified in the IMPDH2 gene, with frequencies of the rarer alleles ranging from 0.5 to 10.2%. A novel nonsynonymous variant L263F was identified, and the kinetic assay demonstrated that the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity of L263F variant was decreased to 10% of the wild-type. The Ki for mycophenolic acid inhibition of the L263F variant was comparable with the wild-type, and the variant Km for inosine 5'-monophosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: IMPDH2 has low genetic diversity, but the nonsynonymous variant L263F has a significant impact on inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity. This novel functional variant may be one of the factors contributing to the inter-individual difference of baseline inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity as well as drug efficacy and adverse events in transplant patients.

17498496|t|[Effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta, its correlative factors and cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats].
17498496|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on mRNA expressions of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), cysteinyl-aspartate specific protease-1 (caspase-1), caspase-3 and caspase-8 after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in rats was induced by the method of nylon monofilament via the internal carotid artery. PNS was administered intraperitoneally respectively five minutes before cerebral ischemia and twelve hours after cerebral ischemia. After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: After cerebral ischemia for two hours followed by reperfusion for twenty two hours, the mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra, ICAM-1, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in brain tissue in the untreated group were obviously elevated as compared to those in the sham-operation group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1RI, IL-1ra in brain tissue in the PNS group were lower than those in the untreated group, but higher than those in the sham-operation group, and without statistical differences as compared to those in the sham-operation group and in the untreated group (P>0.05). The mRNA expression level of caspase-3 in brain tissue in the PNS group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group (P<0.05), but PNS had no effect on the mRNA expression levels of ICAM-1, caspase-1 and caspase-8 in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: PNS can inhibit the mRNA expression of caspase-3, slightly inhibit the mRNA expressions of IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue. The protective effects of PNS on cerebral injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion may be related to inhibiting the mRNA expressions of caspase-3, IL-1 beta and its correlative inflammatory factors in brain tissue.

17512091|t|Downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice CNS: implications in excitotoxicity.
17512091|a|Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. Maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-N-oxalyl amino-L-alanine (L-BOAA), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. L-BOAA causes loss of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. Reducing GSH levels in female mice CNS by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or L-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex I activity, unlike male mice. Further, treatment of female mice depleted of GSH with L-BOAA did not induce inhibition of complex I indicating that GSH levels were not critical for maintaining complex I activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. Glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex I activity. Female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain CNS regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to L-BOAA toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex I loss. Ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to L-BOAA toxicity as evidenced by activation of AP1, loss of GSH and complex I activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. Estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the CNS. Therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.

17550897|t|The calponin homology domain of Vav1 associates with calmodulin and is prerequisite to T cell antigen receptor-induced calcium release in Jurkat T lymphocytes.
17550897|a|Vav1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells and plays important roles in T cell development and activation. Vav1 consists of multiple structural domains so as to facilitate both its guanine nucleotide exchange activity and scaffold function following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement. Previous studies demonstrated that the calponin homology (CH) domain of Vav1 is required for TCR-stimulated calcium mobilization and thus downstream activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. However, it remained obscure how Vav1 functions in regulating calcium flux. In an effort to explore molecules interacting with Vav1, we found that calmodulin bound to Vav1 in a calcium-dependent and TCR activation-independent manner. The binding site was mapped to the CH domain of Vav1. Reconstitution of vav1-null Jurkat T cells (J.Vav1) with CH-deleted Vav1 exhibited a severe deficiency in calcium release to the same extent as that of Jurkat cells treated with the calmodulin inhibitor or J.Vav1 cells. The defect persisted even when phospholipase-Cgamma1 was fully activated, indicating a prerequisite role of Vav1 CH domain in calcium signaling. The results suggest that Vav1 and calmodulin function cooperatively to potentiate TCR-induced calcium release. This study unveiled a mechanism by which the Vav1 CH domain is involved in calcium signaling and provides insight into our understanding of the role of Vav1 in T cell activation.

17554001|t|The transporters GlyT2 and VIAAT cooperate to determine the vesicular glycinergic phenotype.
17554001|a|The mechanisms that specify the vesicular phenotype of inhibitory interneurons in vertebrates are poorly understood because the two main inhibitory transmitters, glycine and GABA, share the same vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) and are both present in neurons during postnatal development. We have expressed VIAAT and the plasmalemmal transporters for glycine and GABA in a neuroendocrine cell line and measured the quantal release of glycine and GABA using a novel double-sniffer patch-clamp technique. We found that glycine is released from vesicles when VIAAT is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter GlyT2 or the glial transporter GlyT1. However, GlyT2 was more effective than GlyT1, probably because GlyT2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic glycine concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by VIAAT. The vesicular inhibitory phenotype was gradually altered from glycinergic to GABAergic through mixed events when GABA is introduced into the secretory cell and competes for uptake by VIAAT. Interestingly, the VIAAT ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports glycine exocytosis in the presence of GlyT2, and a point mutation of UNC-47 that abolishes GABA transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity. Together, these results suggest that an increased cytosolic availability of glycine in VIAAT-containing terminals was crucial for the emergence of glycinergic transmission in vertebrates.

17578749|t|Biochemical assessments of total antioxidant status in active and nonactive female adults with intellectual disability.
17578749|a|Long-term physical activity is known to increase the antioxidant defense (AOD) system, whereas sedentary lifestyle is associated with oxidative stress (OS). The underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The aim of this prospective, nonrandomized study was to evaluate and compare the relationship between long-term physical activity and inactivity and plasma antioxidant status in female adults with intellectual disability (ID) that were diagnosed after birth. A total of 21 adults with ID were examined. The following AOD was examined: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), vitamin E, and vitamin A. Inactive persons with ID had significantly lower SOD (p<0.05), CAT (p<0.05), and GPX (p<0.05). All plasma vitamin levels were significantly higher in physically active subjects (vitamin A: 1.42 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, vitamin E: 31.32 +/- 2.62 mmol/l) than in sedentary control subjects (vitamin A: 1.02 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, vitamin E: 18.88 +/- 2.23 mmol/l) p<0.01. These results suggest that regular physical activity is associated with preserved AODs in adults with ID. As opposed to a physically active lifestyle, an inactive results in low levels of antioxidants.

17581967|t|Na+/Cl- dipole couples agonist binding to kainate receptor activation.
17581967|a|Kainate-selective ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) require external Na+ and Cl- as well as the neurotransmitter L-glutamate for activation. Although, external anions and cations apparently coactivate kainate receptors (KARs) in an identical manner, it has yet to be established how ions of opposite charge achieve this. An additional complication is that KARs are subject to other forms of cation modulation via extracellular acidification (i.e., protons) and divalent ions. Consequently, other cation species may compete with Na+ to regulate the time KARs remain in the open state. Here we designed experiments to unravel how external ions regulate GluR6 KARs. We show that GluR6 kinetics are unaffected by alterations in physiological pH but that divalent and alkali metal ions compete to determine the time course of KAR channel activity. Additionally, Na+ and Cl- ions coactivate GluR6 receptors by establishing a dipole, accounting for their common effect on KARs. Using charged amino acids as tethered ions, we further demonstrate that the docking order is fixed with cations binding first, followed by anions. Together, our findings identify the dipole as a novel gating feature that couples neurotransmitter binding to KAR activation.

17590520|t|Nicotine receptor gene CHRNA4 modulates early event-related potentials in auditory and visual oddball target detection tasks.
17590520|a|The present study seeks to identify effects of a common genetic polymorphism in the human nicotinic alpha4beta2 receptor on components of the cognitive event-related potentials in auditory and visual modalities. The same sense thymine-to-cytosine polymorphism (c.1629T-C; Ser543Ser) was shown to preferentially modulate early components in both modalities. Specifically, the auditory N1 component amplitude was higher for T allele homozygotes than for C allele carriers. The visual P1 component revealed the same pattern of significant polymorphic modulation, but the later N1 amplitude differences were only marginally significant. There was no reliable indication of interactions between genotype and task factors. Parallel modulation of early latency modality-specific event-related potential (ERP) components in vision and audition may indicate that the CHRNA4 polymorphism affects factors that are common to top-down modulation of sensory processing across modalities.

It was clinically tested for Alzheimer's disease, with moderate success in initial Phase II studies. Phenserine deserves attention for an additional quality of action: in addition to inhibiting AChE, it modulates the amount of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neuronal cell culture by reducing APP translation. This effect probably involves interaction of phenserine with a regulatory element in the 5'-untranslated region of the APP gene that controls APP expression. Phenserine apparently reduces translational efficiency of APP mRNA into protein, a process that may involve an interaction with iron and/or an iron-responsive element. As a consequence, phenserine reduces beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) formation in vitro and in vivo. Phenserine is also unique because of differing actions of its enantiomers: (-)-phenserine is the active enantiomer for inhibition of AChE, whereas (+)-phenserine ('posiphen') has weak activity as an AChE inhibitor and can be dosed much higher. Both enantiomers are equipotent in downregulating APP expression. (+)-Posiphen may be a promising drug, either alone or in combination with (-)-phenserine, to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

17603545|t|Alpha1-adrenoceptors are required for normal male sexual function.
17603545|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Among the side effects, ejaculatory dysfunction occurs more frequently with drugs that are relatively selective for alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors compared with other drugs of this class. This suggests that alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors may contribute to ejaculation. However, this has not been studied at the molecular level. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The physiological contribution of each alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype was characterized using alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective knockout (KO) mice (alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR KO mice) since the subtype-specific drugs available are only moderately selective. We analysed the role of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the blood pressure and vascular response as well as ejaculation by determining these variables in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective KO mice and in mice with all their alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted (alpha(1)-AR triple-KO mice). KEY RESULTS: The pregnancy rate was reduced by 50% in alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor KO mice, and this reduction was dramatically enhanced in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-KO mice. Contractile tension of the vas deferens in response to noradrenaline was markedly decreased in alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor KO mice, and this contraction was completely abolished in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-KO mice. This attenuation of contractility was also observed in the electrically stimulated vas deferens. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrate that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, particularly alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, are required for normal contractility of the vas deferens and consequent sperm ejaculation as well as having a function in fertility.

17603555|t|Pharmacological activators of AMP-activated protein kinase have different effects on Na+ transport processes across human lung epithelial cells.
17603555|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by metformin, phenformin, and the AMP mimetic, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR). We have completed an extensive study of the pharmacological effects of these drugs on AMPK activation, adenine nucleotide concentration, transepithelial amiloride-sensitive (I(amiloride)) and ouabain-sensitive basolateral (I(ouabain)) short circuit current in H441 lung epithelial cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: H441 cells were grown on permeable filters at air interface. I(amiloride), I(ouabain) and transepithelial resistance were measured in Ussing chambers. AMPK activity was measured as the amount of radiolabelled phosphate transferred to the SAMS peptide. Adenine nucleotide concentration was analysed by reverse phase HPLC and NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy. KEY RESULTS: Phenformin, AICAR and metformin increased AMPK (alpha1) activity and decreased I(amiloride). The AMPK inhibitor Compound C prevented the action of metformin and AICAR but not phenformin. Phenformin and AICAR decreased I(ouabain) across H441 monolayers and decreased monolayer resistance. The decrease in I(amiloride) was closely related to I(ouabain) with phenformin, but not in AICAR treated monolayers. Metformin and phenformin increased the cellular AMP:ATP ratio but only phenformin and AICAR decreased cellular ATP. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Activation of alpha1-AMPK is associated with inhibition of apical amiloride-sensitive Na(+) channels (ENaC), which has important implications for the clinical use of metformin. Additional pharmacological effects evoked by AICAR and phenformin on I(ouabain), with potential secondary effects on apical Na+ conductance, ENaC activity and monolayer resistance, have important consequences for their use as pharmacological activators of AMPK in cell systems where Na+K+ATPase is an important component.

17604186|t|Neuroprotective effect of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chemical kindling and associated biochemical parameters in mice.
17604186|a|Brain cyclooxygenases (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Previous studies have explored the protective effect of naproxen (non-selective COX-inhibitor) or rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) against chemical kindling in mice. With this background, the present study was designed to explore the possible effect of nimesulide (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor) against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling epilepsy in mice. To induce kindling, PTZ was injected in a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 15 days. Nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered each day 45 min before either PTZ or vehicle challenge. The intensity of kindling was assessed immediately after PTZ administration according to a prevalidated scoring scale. On 16th day i.e. 24 h after the last dose of PTZ, animals were sacrificed and various biochemical parameters were assessed in the whole brain. Compared with normal control group, PTZ-kindled mice had significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite, myeloperoxidase but had lower levels of reduced glutathione in the whole brain homogenate. Chronic treatment with nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in kindling score and could play a role in controlling the accompanying biochemical alterations due to PTZ. These results suggested that nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor offered neuroprotection against PTZ-induced kindling in mice.

17617661|t|Glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms, cruciferous vegetable intake and cancer risk in the Central and Eastern European Kidney Cancer Study.
17617661|a|High consumption of cruciferous vegetables has been associated with reduced kidney cancer risk in many studies. Isothiocyanates, thought to be responsible for the chemopreventive properties of this food group, are conjugated to glutathione by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) before urinary excretion. Modification of this relationship by host genetic factors is unknown. We investigated cruciferous vegetable intake in 1097 cases and 1555 controls enrolled in a multicentric case-control study from the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Russia. To assess possible gene-diet interactions, genotyped cases (N = 925) and controls (N = 1247) for selected functional or non-synonymous polymorphisms including the GSTM1 deletion, GSTM3 3 bp deletion (IVS6 + 22-AGG) and V224I G>A substitution, GSTT1 deletion and the GSTP1 I105V A>G substitution. The odds ratio (OR) for low (less than once per month) versus high (at least once per week) intake of cruciferous vegetables was 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.62; P-trend = 0.03]. When low intake of cruciferous vegetables (less than once per month) was stratified by GST genotype, higher kidney cancer risks were observed among individuals with the GSTT1 null (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.07-3.23; P-interaction = 0.05) or with both GSTM1/T1 null genotypes (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.08-5.77; P-interaction = 0.05). These data provide additional evidence for the role of cruciferous vegetables in cancer prevention among individuals with common, functional genetic polymorphisms.

17627474|t|Regulated function of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) oxygen sensor proteins.
17627474|a|Cellular oxygen is sensed by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins that hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits. Under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated HIFalpha is bound by the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor, leading to ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, hydroxylation becomes reduced, leading to HIFalpha stabilization. The authors recently showed that changes in PHD abundance and activity can regulate HIFalpha stability under normoxic as well as under hypoxic conditions. Thus, the PHD oxygen sensors themselves represent effectors of cellular signalling pathways as well as potential drug targets. Here, a cell-free in vitro microtiter plate-based peptide hydroxylation assay was used to investigate the influence of ferrous iron, Krebs cycle intermediates, transition metals, and vitamin C and other antioxidants on the activity of purified PHD1 to 3. PHD activity depends not only on oxygen availability but is also regulated by iron, vitamin C, and Krebs cycle intermediates, suggesting a physiological relevance of their cellular concentrations. Copper but not iron, cobalt, or nickel salts catalyzed vitamin C oxidation. While vitamin C is essential for PHD activity in vitro, N-acetyl-L-cysteine had no effect, and gallic acid or n-propyl gallate efficiently inhibited the activity of all three PHDs, demonstrating different functions of these antioxidants.

17632548|t|Crystal structure of a human membrane protein involved in cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis.
17632548|a|The cysteinyl leukotrienes, namely leukotriene (LT)C4 and its metabolites LTD4 and LTE4, the components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, are lipid mediators of smooth muscle constriction and inflammation, particularly implicated in bronchial asthma. LTC4 synthase (LTC4S), the pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of LTC4 (ref. 10), is an 18-kDa integral nuclear membrane protein that belongs to a superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism that includes 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, microsomal glutathione S-transferases (MGSTs), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (ref. 13). LTC4S conjugates glutathione to LTA4, the endogenous substrate derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast with MGST2 and MGST3 (refs 15, 16), LTC4S does not conjugate glutathione to xenobiotics. Here we show the atomic structure of human LTC4S in a complex with glutathione at 3.3 A resolution by X-ray crystallography and provide insights into the high substrate specificity for glutathione and LTA4 that distinguishes LTC4S from other MGSTs. The LTC4S monomer has four transmembrane alpha-helices and forms a threefold symmetric trimer as a unit with functional domains across each interface. Glutathione resides in a U-shaped conformation within an interface between adjacent monomers, and this binding is stabilized by a loop structure at the top of the interface. LTA4 would fit into the interface so that Arg 104 of one monomer activates glutathione to provide the thiolate anion that attacks C6 of LTA4 to form a thioether bond, and Arg 31 in the neighbouring monomer donates a proton to form a hydroxyl group at C5, resulting in 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4). These findings provide a structural basis for the development of LTC4S inhibitors for a proinflammatory pathway mediated by three cysteinyl leukotriene ligands whose stability and potency are different and by multiple cysteinyl leukotriene receptors whose functions may be non-redundant.

17704420|t|FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms associated with clinical outcome of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with single-agent cetuximab.
17704420|a|PURPOSE: Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb), has shown efficacy in 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies demonstrate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the modes of action for rituximab and trastuzumab. Fragment c (Fc) portion of IgG1 mAb has shown to induce ADCC. Fragment c gamma receptors (FcgammaR) play an important role in initiating ADCC. Studies have shown that two IgG FcgammaR polymorphisms (FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F) independently predict response to rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma. We tested the hypothesis of whether these two polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with single-agent cetuximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine metastatic CRC patients were enrolled onto the ImClone0144 trial. Using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method, gene polymorphisms of FCGA2A-H131R and FCGA3A-V158F were assessed from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F polymorphisms were independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS; P = .037 and .055, respectively; log-rank test). Combined analysis of these two polymorphisms showed that patients with the favorable genotypes (FCGR2A, any histidine allele, and FCGR3A, any phenylalanine allele) showed a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4 months), whereas patients with any two unfavorable genotypes (FCGR2A arginine/arginine or valine/valine) had a PFS of 1.1 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 months; P = .004; log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that these two polymorphisms may be useful molecular markers to predict clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with cetuximab and that they may indicate a role of ADCC of cetuximab.

17768678|t|Phenelzine causes an increase in brain ornithine that is prevented by prior monoamine oxidase inhibition.
17768678|a|Phenelzine (PLZ), a nonselective irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), also inhibits GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), markedly increasing brain GABA levels. PLZ is also a substrate for MAO, and studies suggest that a metabolite formed by the action of this enzyme on PLZ may be responsible for the increase in GABA observed. We have recently found that PLZ also elevates brain ornithine (ORN), an amino acid precursor to both glutamate (and GABA) and the polyamines, and have conducted dose- and time-response studies on this effect. Rats were treated with vehicle or PLZ doses (7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg i.p.), and brains were collected 3 h later. In the time-response study, animals were treated with vehicle or PLZ (15 mg/kg i.p.) and brains were collected 1-24 h later. To determine whether a metabolite formed by the action of MAO on PLZ may be responsible for the elevation in brain ORN observed, animals were pretreated with vehicle or the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) before vehicle or PLZ (15 mg/kg), and brains collected 3 h later. ORN levels (measured by an HPLC procedure) were dose- and time-dependently increased in PLZ-treated animals, with levels reaching approximately 650% of control at 6 and 12 h. Pretreatment with TCP completely abolished the PLZ-induced increase in brain ORN, suggesting, as with GABA, that a metabolite of PLZ formed by the action of MAO is responsible for the elevation of brain ORN observed.

17869551|t|Endothelial nitric oxide production is tightly coupled to the citrulline-NO cycle.
17869551|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasorelaxant produced along with L-citrulline from L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Previous studies suggested that the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is essential for NO production in endothelial cells. However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the degree to which the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is coupled to NO production. We hypothesized that the amount of NO formed would be significantly higher than the amount of L-citrulline formed due to the efficiency of L-citrulline recycling via the citrulline-NO cycle. To test this hypothesis, endothelial cells were incubated with [14C]-L-arginine and stimulated by various agents to produce NO. The extent of NO and [14C]-L-citrulline formation were simultaneously determined. NO production exceeded apparent L-citrulline formation of the order of 8 to 1, under both basal and stimulated conditions. As further support, alpha-methyl-DL-aspartate, an inhibitor of argininosuccinate synthase (AS), a component of the citrulline-NO cycle, inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner. The results of this study provide evidence for the essential and efficient coupling of L-citrulline recycling, via the citrulline-NO cycle, to endothelial NO production.

17916059|t|The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders.
17916059|a|Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.

17980251|t|Inhibition of platelet aggregation by AZD6140, a reversible oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist, compared with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
17980251|a|OBJECTIVES: In a substudy of DISPERSE (Dose confIrmation Study assessing anti-Platelet Effects of AZD6140 vs. clopidogRel in non-ST-segment Elevation myocardial infarction)-2, we compared the antiplatelet effects of AZD6140 and clopidogrel and assessed the effects of AZD6140 in clopidogrel-pretreated patients. BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel, in combination with aspirin, reduces cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, patients with poor inhibition of platelet aggregation with clopidogrel may be less well protected. AZD6140 is a reversible oral P2Y(12) receptor antagonist that has been studied in ACS patients in comparison with clopidogrel (DISPERSE-2 study). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either AZD6140 90 mg twice a day, AZD6140 180 mg twice a day, or clopidogrel 75 mg once a day for up to 12 weeks in a double-blind, double-dummy design. One-half the patients allocated AZD6140 received a 270-mg loading dose. Patients randomized to receive clopidogrel were given a 300-mg loading dose unless they had already been treated with clopidogrel. Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was assessed by optical aggregometry on day 1 and at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: AZD6140 inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion and both doses achieved greater levels of inhibition than clopidogrel (e.g., 4 weeks, 4-h postdose [mean (+/-SD)]: clopidogrel 64% [+/-22%], AZD6140 90 mg 79% [+/-22%], AZD6140 180 mg 95% [+/-8%]. AZD6140 also produced further suppression of platelet aggregation in patients previously treated with clopidogrel. CONCLUSIONS: AZD6140 exhibited greater mean inhibition of platelet aggregation than a standard regimen of clopidogrel in ACS patients. In addition, AZD6140 further suppressed platelet aggregation in clopidogrel pretreated patients.

18045203|t|The preparation and human muscarinic receptor profiling of oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin enantiomers.
18045203|a|Oxybutynin (1) is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist that is used clinically for the treatment of urinary incontinence. The major metabolite of oxybutynin in humans is desethyloxybutynin (2). We have prepared the enantiomers of 1 and 2 and evaluated their ability to displace N-CT(3)-scopolamine chloride ((3)H-NMS) binding on human cloned muscarinic m1-5 receptors. Compounds 1 and 2 potently displaced (3)H-NMS binding at m1, m3 and m4 receptors, but were less potent at the m2 and m5 subtypes. However, metabolite 2 was more potent than the parent compound 1 in the binding assay. In general the R enantiomers were more potent than their respective S enantiomers. Therefore, we suggest that the cholinergic side effects associated with 2 may be due to its greater apparent potency with m1 and m3 receptors, especially of its R-enantiomer, when compared with parent drug 1.

18450949|t|Degradation of submandibular gland AQP5 by parasympathetic denervation of chorda tympani and its recovery by cevimeline, an M3 muscarinic receptor agonist.
18450949|a|By chorda tympani denervation (CTD, parasympathectomy), the aquaporin 5 (AQP5), but not AQP1, protein level in the rat submandibular gland (SMG) was significantly decreased, dropping to 37% of that of the contralateral gland at 4 wk. The protein levels of AQP5 and AQP1 were not significantly affected by denervation of the cervical sympathetic trunk (sympathectomy). Administration of cevimeline hydrochloride, an M3 muscarinic receptor agonist (10 mg/kg for 7 days po), but not pilocarpine (0.3 mg/kg for 7 days po), recovered the AQP5 protein level reduced by CTD and increased the AQP1 protein level above the control one. The mRNA level of AQP5 was scarcely affected by CTD and cevimeline hydrochloride administration. Administration of chloroquine (50 mg/kg for 7 days po), a denaturant of lysosomes, increased the AQP5 protein level reduced by CTD. An extract obtained from the submandibular lysosomal fraction degraded the AQP5 protein in the total membrane fraction in vitro. These results suggest the possible regulation of the AQP5 protein level in the SMG by the parasympathetic nerves/M3 muscarinic receptor agonist and imply the involvement of lysosomal enzymes, but not a transcriptional mechanism, in this regulation.

18466433|t|Multicenter trial of everolimus in pediatric renal transplant recipients: results at three year.
18466433|a|There are few prospective clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors (or proliferation signal inhibitors) combined with CNI inhibitors in de novo pediatric renal transplantation. Results reported here are from a multicenter, open-label study in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients (<or=16 yr), in which patients received everolimus with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one yr, then entered an extension study for a further two yr. Nineteen patients completed the one-yr study, of whom three discontinued study medication. Fifteen of the remaining 16 patients entered the extension study, eight of whom were aged <10 yr (Group 1) and seven were aged 10-16 yr (Group 2). Mean daily dose of everolimus during the first 36 months was 1.53 mg/m(2) BSA. Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients in Group 2 and in one patient in Group 1. Biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection was reported in four patients (two in each age group). Graft survival at one yr was 100%; one patient in Group 2 lost their graft subsequently during the extension. For patients entering the extension, patient survival at three yr was 100%. There were three cases of viral infection, including one case of cytomegalovirus infection. At three yr, mean total cholesterol was 5.5 +/- 0.8 mm/L (213 +/- 31 mg/dL) and four patients received statin therapy. Mean serum creatinine at 36 months was 96 +/- 36 microm/L (1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dL). This is the first long-term prospective study to demonstrate that a regimen of everolimus, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids provides good efficacy, tolerability, and safety in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients.

18480678|t|Differential pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate enantiomers: does chirality matter?
18480678|a|d,l-threo-methylphenidate (MPH) is an effective first-line treatment for the symptoms associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. threo-methylphenidate inhibits the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine transporter, resulting in elevations of these monoamines after impulse release. Although MPH has long been administered as a racemic mixture of the 2 enantiomers, d-MPH and l-MPH, converging lines of evidence drawn from investigations using in vitro systems, animal models, and humans indicate that it is predominantly, if not exclusively, d-MPH that mediates the pharmacological/therapeutic actions of MPH. In both rodent and primate animal models, the binding of radiolabeled d-MPH to dopamine transporter was found to be selective, saturable, and reversible, whereas binding of l-MPH was diffuse and nonspecific. The behavioral effects of the enantiomers of MPH have been tested in several animal models, and results indicate these observed behavioral changes are likewise mediated by d-MPH, whereas l-MPH has little or no effect.The contribution of the l-isomer to the overall pharmacological profile of the racemate remains unclear, owing to several studies suggesting that l-MPH may not be merely an inert isomeric ballast. For example, behavioral studies conducted in rats demonstrate an attenuation of the effect of d-MPH in animals pretreated with l-MPH, suggesting that l-MPH may interfere with the action of the active enantiomer. The importance of MPH chirality to central nervous system MPH receptor targeting has culminated in human imaging studies revealing that d-MPH binds specifically to striatal structures, whereas l-MPH binding is nonspecific. Taken together, data from in vitro, animal, and human studies support the premise that the d-enantiomer of MPH mediates the neurophysiological actions of MPH and therefore likely mediates its clinical efficacy.

18593822|t|Identification of N-terminal receptor activity-modifying protein residues important for calcitonin gene-related peptide, adrenomedullin, and amylin receptor function.
18593822|a|Calcitonin-family receptors comprise calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CL) or calcitonin receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) pairings. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors are CL/RAMP1, whereas adrenomedullin (AM) receptors are CL/RAMP2 (AM1 receptor) or CL/RAMP3 (AM2 receptor). Amylin (Amy) receptors are RAMP hetero-oligomers with the calcitonin receptor (AMY1, AMY2, and AMY3, respectively). How RAMPs change G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology is not fully understood. We exploited sequence differences between RAMP1 and RAMP3 to identify individual residues capable of altering receptor pharmacology. Alignment of human RAMPs revealed eight residues that are conserved in RAMP2 and RAMP3 but are different in RAMP1. We hypothesized that residues in RAMP2 and RAMP3, but not RAMP1, are responsible for making CL/RAMP2 and CL/RAMP3 AM receptors. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced individual RAMP3 residues into RAMP1 and vice versa in these eight positions. Mutant or wild-type RAMPs were transfected into Cos7 cells with CL or the insert-negative form of the calcitonin receptor [CT(a)]. Agonist-stimulated cAMP production and cell-surface expression of constructs were measured. Position 74 in RAMP1 and RAMP3 was critical for determining AM potency and affinity, and Phe93 in RAMP1 was an important contributor to alphaCGRP potency at CGRP receptors. Mutant RAMP/CT(a) receptor complexes displayed different phenotypes. It is noteworthy that RAMP1 S103N and W74E mutations led to enhanced rAmy potency, probably related to increased cell-surface expression of these complexes. This differs from the effect on CL-based receptors where expression was unchanged. Targeted substitution has emphasized the importance of position 74 in RAMP1/RAMP3 as a key determinant of AM pharmacology.

18593927|t|Nitrosoureas inhibit the stathmin-mediated migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells.
18593927|a|Malignant gliomas are the most common primary intrinsic brain tumors and are highly lethal. The widespread migration and invasion of neoplastic cells from the initial site of tumor formation into the surrounding brain render these lesions refractory to definitive surgical treatment. Stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein that mediates cell cycle progression, can also regulate directed cell movement. Nitrosoureas, traditionally viewed as DNA alkylating agents, can also covalently modify proteins such as stathmin. We therefore sought to establish a role for stathmin in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion and determine the effects of nitrosoureas on these cell movement-related processes. Scratch wound-healing recovery, Boyden chamber migration, Matrigel invasion, and organotypic slice invasion assays were performed before and after the down-regulation of cellular stathmin levels and in the absence and presence of sublethal nitrosourea ([1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea]; CCNU) concentrations. We show that decreases in stathmin expression lead to significant decreases in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion. CCNU, at a concentration of 10 micromol/L, causes similar significant decreases, even in the absence of any effects on cell viability. The direct inhibition of stathmin by CCNU is likely a contributing factor. These findings suggest that the inhibition of stathmin expression and function may be useful in limiting the spread of malignant gliomas within the brain, and that nitrosoureas may have therapeutic benefits in addition to their antiproliferative effects.

18604229|t|Interaction with the hERG channel and cytotoxicity of amiodarone and amiodarone analogues.
18604229|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amiodarone (2-n-butyl-3-[3,5 diiodo-4-diethylaminoethoxybenzoyl]-benzofuran, B2-O-CH(2)CH(2)-N-diethyl) is an effective class III antiarrhythmic drug demonstrating potentially life-threatening organ toxicity. The principal aim of the study was to find amiodarone analogues that retained human ether-a-go-go-related protein (hERG) channel inhibition but with reduced cytotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We synthesized amiodarone analogues with or without a positively ionizable nitrogen in the phenolic side chain. The cytotoxic properties of the compounds were evaluated using HepG2 (a hepatocyte cell line) and A549 cells (a pneumocyte line). Interactions of all compounds with the hERG channel were measured using pharmacological and in silico methods. KEY RESULTS: Compared with amiodarone, which displayed only a weak cytotoxicity, the mono- and bis-desethylated metabolites, the further degraded alcohol (B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-OH), the corresponding acid (B2-O-CH(2)-COOH) and, finally, the newly synthesized B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-pyrrolidine were equally or more toxic. Conversely, structural analogues such as the B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-diisopropyl and the B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-piperidine were significantly less toxic than amiodarone. Cytotoxicity was associated with a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting mitochondrial involvement. Pharmacological and in silico investigations concerning the interactions of these compounds with the hERG channel revealed that compounds carrying a basic nitrogen in the side chain display a much higher affinity than those lacking such a group. Specifically, B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-piperidine and B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-pyrrolidine revealed a higher affinity towards hERG channels than amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Amiodarone analogues with better hERG channel inhibition and cytotoxicity profiles than the parent compound have been identified, demonstrating that cytotoxicity and hERG channel interaction are mechanistically distinct and separable properties of the compounds.

18620538|t|Interaction of human alpha-lactalbumin with fatty acids: determination of binding parameters.
18620538|a|The interaction of holo- and apo-forms of human alpha-lactalbumin with fatty acids was studied by a partition equilibrium method. Apo-alpha-lactalbumin, obtained by treatment with EDTA, displays one binding site for fatty acids, the association constants for oleic and palmitic acids being 1.9.10(6) and 4.2.10(5) M(-1), respectively. However, holo-alpha-lactalbumin was unable to bind fatty acids as measured by this technique. Likewise, no fatty acids bound to holo-alpha-lactalbumin, isolated using nondenaturing conditions, were detected by gas chromatography. These results demonstrate that the conformational change induced in alpha-lactalbumin by the removal of calcium enables the protein to interact with fatty acids.

18655903|t|Peptide and non-peptide agonists and antagonists for the vasopressin and oxytocin V1a, V1b, V2 and OT receptors: research tools and potential therapeutic agents.
18655903|a|Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) mediate their biological actions by acting on four known receptors: The OT (uterine) and the AVP V(1a) (vasopressor), V(1b) (pituitary), V(2) (renal) receptors and a fifth putative AVP V(1c)? (vasodilating) receptor. This presentation will summarize some highlights of the recent progress, in the design and synthesis of selective peptide agonists, antagonists, radioiodinated ligands, fluorescent ligands and bivalent ligands for these receptors. Here we present published and unpublished pharmacological data on the most widely used agonists, antagonists and labelled ligands. The pharmacological properties of promising new selective OT antagonists and V(1b) agonists are also presented. This review should serve as a useful guide for the selection of the most appropriate ligand for a given study. The current status of non-peptide OT and AVP antagonists and agonists is also summarized. The relative merits of peptide and non-peptide AVP and OT agonists and antagonists as: (1) research tools and (2) therapeutic agents will be evaluated. Many of the receptor selective peptide agonists and antagonists from this and other laboratories are far more widely used as pharmacological tools for studies on the peripheral and central effects of OT and AVP than their non-peptide counterparts. In addition to OT and to a lesser extent AVP (pitressin), a number of OT and AVP analogues; such as carbetocin (OT agonist) dDAVP (desmopressin, V(2) agonist), terlipressin (V(1a) agonist), felypressin (V(1a) agonist) and atosiban (Tractocile OT antagonist) are also in clinical use. Despite much early promise, no non-peptide V(1a) or OT antagonists are currently in clinical trials. While a number of orally active non-peptide V(2) antagonists (Vaptans); notably, Tolvaptan, Lixivaptan and Satavaptan, are currently in Phase III clinical trials; to date, only the mixed V(2)/V(1a), antagonist Conivaptan (Vaprisol), has been approved by the US FDA for clinical use (by i.v. administration), for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Promising new non-peptide V(1b) and OT antagonists, as well as non-peptide V(2) and OT agonists are now in pre-clinical development.

1868500|t|Mechanisms of lipid-lowering agents.
1868500|a|Lipid-lowering agents are used with the purpose of ameliorating hyperlipoproteinemias, in order to prevent arterial disease. Lipid-lowering drugs can be classified into absorbable agents and into nonabsorbable compounds, acting within the gastrointestinal lumen. Absorbable drugs (fibric acids, nicotinic acid, probucol, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce plasma very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and/or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by a variety of mechanisms. Fibric acids, in particular, act by stimulating the catabolism of VLDL and also, as a consequence, improving LDL delipidation, thus favoring receptor uptake. Nicotinic acid and acipimox interfere with the biosynthesis of LDL and can also improve the clearance of VLDL/LDL. Probucol acts by a newly described mechanism, i.e. accelerating reverse transport of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins to lower-density lipoproteins. Finally, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, interfering with the biosynthesis of cholesterol, can induce an increased expression of liver high-affinity lipoprotein receptors. Nonabsorbable agents (anion-exchange resins, neomycin, beta-sitosterol) interrupt the recirculation of bile acids and/or reduce the absorption of cholesterol with the gut. They display a selective activity on hypercholesterolemia, again by increasing LDL receptor expression. The choice of one or more lipid-lowering agents will depend upon the patient's phenotype, determining responsiveness to the pharmacological treatment.

18803986|t|Lapatinib: a dual inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases.
18803986|a|BACKGROUND: Lapatinib, the first dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) tyrosine kinases, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007. It is indicated for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) whose tumors overexpress HER2 (ErbB2) and who have received previous treatment that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of lapatinib, and its current and potential role in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies. METHODS: Relevant English-language publications were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2008),the American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts database (2000-2007), abstracts from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (2005-2007), and the FDA Web site (January 2008). Search terms included lapatinib, GW572016, HER2, EGFR, receptor tyrosine kinase, dual-receptor blockade, adverse events, and clinical trials. RESULTS: The T(max) of lapatinib after oral administration is 3 to 4 hours. Dividing the dose or administering it with food, particularly a high-fat meal, increases the AUC >2-fold. Lapatinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme, with 1 metabolite remaining active against EGFR but not HER2. Due to drug accumulation, the t(1/2) of lapatinib is 24 hours with continuous dosing. In a Phase III trial comparing lapatinib and capecitabine with capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive, locally advanced breast cancer or MBC that had progressed after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab, the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine was associated with a numeric improvement in response rate compared with capecitabine alone (22% vs 14%, respectively; P = NS) and a significant increase in time to progression (6.2 vs 4.3 months; hazard ratio = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.77; P < 0.001). Lapatinib has been reported to have antitumor activity in Phase II trials when used as first-line therapy for MBC, in patients with inflammatory breast cancer, and in patients with central nervous system metastases. Phase II trials in other solid tumor types found modest activity. The approved dosing of lapatinib is 1,250 mg PO QD given continuously in combination with capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) daily administered in 2 divided doses on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle. The most common clinical toxicities of all grades associated with lapatinib used in combination with capecitabine in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhea (65%), hand-foot syndrome (53%), nausea (44%), rash (29%), and fatigue (24%). Cardiac toxicity appears to be less frequent with lapatinib than with trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases. It is approved by the FDA for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive MBC that has progressed with standard treatment. In clinical trials, this combination was associated with a significant improvement in the time to progression in patients with MBC. Lapatinib's efficacy in other malignancies that overexpress EGFR and/or HER2 is under evaluation.

1881457|t|N2-acetylphenelzine: effects on rat brain GABA, alanine and biogenic amines.
1881457|a|The neurochemical properties of N2-acetylphenelzine were compared with those of phenelzine in a rat model. N2-Acetylphenelzine is a relatively potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A and -B and causes increases in whole-brain levels of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, and decreases in homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acetic after acute i.p. administration of the drug. Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases. Acetylation of phenelzine at the N2 position presumably interferes with the inhibition of the transaminase enzymes for gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine.

18973551|t|Dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists increase dendrite arborization of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation.
18973551|a|Clinical improvements in Parkinson's disease produced by dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists have been related to their neuroprotective actions and, more recently, to their neuroregenerative properties. However, it is unclear whether dopamine agonists produce their neurotrophic effects by acting directly on receptors expressed by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons or indirectly on receptors expressed by astrocytes, via release of neurotrophic factors. In this study, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists quinpirole and 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT), as well as of the indirect agonist amphetamine, on dopaminergic neurons identified by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Experiments were performed on neuronal-enriched primary cultures containing less than 0.5% of astrocytes prepared from the mouse embryo mesencephalon. After 3 days of incubation, both quinpirole (1-10 microm) and 7-OH-DPAT (5-500 nm) dose-dependently increased the maximal dendrite length (P < 0.001), number of primary dendrites (P < 0.01) and [3H]dopamine uptake (P < 0.01) of TH-IR-positive mesencephalic neurons. Similar effects were observed with 10 microm amphetamine. All neurotrophic effects were blocked by the unselective D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5 microm) and by the selective D3 receptor antagonist SB-277011-A at a low dose (50 nm). Quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) within minutes, an effect blocked by pretreatment with SB-277011-A. Inhibition of the D2/D3 receptor signalling pathway to ERK was obtained with PD98059, GF109203 or LY294002, resulting in blockade of neurotrophic effects. These data suggest that dopamine agonists increase dendritic arborizations of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via a direct effect on D2/D3 receptors, preferentially involving D3 receptor-dependent neurotransmission.

18974361|t|Molecular pharmacology of human Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels: block by antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, and their analogs.
18974361|a|Antihypertensive drugs of the "calcium channel blocker" or "calcium antagonist" class have been used to establish the physiological role of L-type Ca(2+) channels in vascular smooth muscle. In contrast, there has been limited progress on the pharmacology T-type Ca(2+) channels. T-type channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking, aldosterone secretion, and renal hemodynamics, leading to the hypothesis that mixed T- and L-type blockers may have therapeutic advantages over selective L-type blockers. The goal of this study was to identify compounds that block the Ca(v)3.2 T-type channel with high affinity, focusing on two classes of compounds: phenylalkylamines (e.g., mibefradil) and dihydropyridines (e.g., efonidipine). Compounds were tested using a validated Ca(2+) influx assay into a cell line expressing recombinant Ca(v)3.2 channels. This study identified four clinically approved antihypertensive drugs (efonidipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nitrendipine) as potent T-channel blockers (IC(50) < 3 microM). In contrast, other widely prescribed dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine and nifedipine, were 10-fold less potent, making them a more appropriate choice in research studies on the role of L-type currents. In summary, the present results support the notion that many available antihypertensive drugs block a substantial fraction of T-current at therapeutically relevant concentrations, contributing to their mechanism of action.

19002123|t|The role of combination medical therapy in benign prostatic hyperplasia.
19002123|a|To review key trials of monotherapy and combination therapy of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha(1)-ARAs), 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5alphaRIs) and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapies for LUTS associated with BPH, a search of the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases (1976-2008) was conducted for relevant trials and reviews using the terms benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, anti-muscarinics, anticholinergics, combination therapy, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, dutasteride, finasteride, tolterodine, flavoxate, propiverine, oxybutynin, erectile dysfunction, sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil. Data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study indicated a role for long-term use of alpha(1)-ARAs and 5alphaRIs in combination. In the MTOPS study, combination therapy with the alpha(1)-ARA doxazosin and the 5alphaRI finasteride was significantly more effective than either component alone in reducing symptoms (P=0.006 vs doxazosin monotherapy; P<0.001 vs finasteride monotherapy) and in lowering the rate of clinical progression (P<0.001 vs either monotherapy). These findings were confirmed by the 2-year preliminary results of the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin study. In this study, combination therapy of the alpha(1)-ARA tamsulosin and the 5alphaRI dutasteride resulted in a significantly greater decrease in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) when compared with either monotherapy. Several recent trials have studied the efficacy of combining alpha(1)-ARAs and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of BPH. These studies have found this combination to result in statistically significant benefits in quality of life scores, patient satisfaction, urinary frequency, storage symptoms and IPSS scores. Studies have not shown an increased risk of urinary retention associated with the use of anti-muscarinics in a highly select cohort of men with BPH. The available data suggest that combination therapy can be beneficial in the treatment of BPH and associated LUTS. The greatest efficacy for the alpha(1)-ARA and 5alphaRI combination was shown in patients with larger prostate size and more severe symptoms. The combination of alpha(1)-ARAs and 5alphaRIs appears to prevent disease progression in these patients. The combination of alpha(1)-ARAs with anti-muscarinic agents is useful for relieving symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor overactivity. Theoretic concerns regarding the risk of acute urinary retention have been refuted in several recent clinical trials; however, it must be noted that the patients in these trials were a highly select cohort of men. Men with overactive bladder and BPH who are not receiving adequate alleviation of symptoms from the first-line alpha(1)-ARAs may benefit from the addition of an anti-muscarinic agent.

19023039|t|Pharmacological characterization of pannexin-1 currents expressed in mammalian cells.
19023039|a|Pannexin (Panx) 1 is a widely expressed protein that shares structural, but not amino acid, homology with gap junction proteins, the connexins. Panx1 does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. Little is known of the pharmacological properties of panx1 expression in mammalian cells. Here, we identify three variants in the human PANX1 gene. We expressed these variants and mouse Panx1 in mammalian cells and compared Panx1-induced currents. All human Panx1 variants and the mouse Panx1 showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent. Panx1 currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase C transduction. We found compounds that inhibited Panx1 currents with a rank order of potency: carbenoxolone > disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) approximately disodium 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2'-disulfonate approximately 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid > indanyloxyacetic acid 94 >> probenecid >> flufenamic acid = niflumic acid. Triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and UTP) rapidly and reversibly inhibited Panx1 currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. When Panx1 was coexpressed with purinergic P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R), DIDS was found to act as a P2X(7)R antagonist to inhibit ATP-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited P2X(7)R currents. This is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of Panx1-mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that Panx1 acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to P2X(7)R activation.

19057128|t|Captopril attenuates matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats.
19057128|a|Little is known about the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in right ventricular remodeling. We investigated the effect of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline. The rats were administrated captopril (30 mg/kg per day) or a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection. At day 25, echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised. Expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by Western blotting and by gelatin zymography, respectively. In monocrotaline-injected rats, right ventricular weight/tail length ratio increased significantly. Histological analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections. Echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats. The right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. However, captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them. These findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in rats.

19119014|t|Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Comparison of chlorthalidone, indapamide, trichloromethiazide, and furosemide X-ray crystal structures in adducts with isozyme II, when several water molecules make the difference.
19119014|a|Thiazide and high ceiling diuretics were recently shown to inhibit all mammalian isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) with a very different profile as compared to classical inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and ethoxzolamide. Some of these structurally related compounds have a very different behavior against the widespread isozyme CA II, with chlorthalidone, trichloromethiazide, and furosemide being efficient inhibitors against CA II (K(I)s of 65-138 nM), whereas indapamide is a much weaker one (K(I) of 2520 nM). Furthermore, some of these diuretics are quite efficient (low nanomolar) inhibitors of other isoforms, for example, chlorthalidone against hCA VB, VII, IX, and XIII; indapamide against CA VII, IX, XII, and XIII, trichloromethiazide against CA VII and IX, and furosemide against CA I and XIV. Examining the four X-ray crystal structures of their CA II adducts, we observed several (2-3) active site water molecules interacting with the chlorthalidone, trichloromethiazide, and furosemide scaffolds which may be responsible for this important difference of activity. Indeed, indapamide bound to CA II has no interactions with active site water molecules. Chlorthalidone bound within the CA II active site is in an enolic (lactimic) tautomeric form, with the enolic OH also participating in two strong hydrogen bonds with Asn67 and a water molecule. The newly evidenced binding modes of these diuretics may be exploited for designing better CA II inhibitors as well as compounds with selectivity/affinity for various isoforms with medicinal chemistry applications.

19281809|t|Sergliflozin etabonate, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, improves glycemic control in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and Zucker fatty rats.
19281809|a|The low-affinity sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) is responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney and has been highlighted as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. We discovered sergliflozin etabonate, a novel selective SGLT2 inhibitor, and found that selective inhibition of SGLT2 increased urinary glucose excretion and consequently decreased plasma glucose levels. In this report, we examined the antihyperglycemic effects of sergliflozin etabonate in normal and diabetic rats in comparison with those of a sulfonylurea (gliclazide) and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (voglibose). Sergliflozin etabonate increased urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited the increase in plasma glucose after sucrose loading independently of insulin secretion in normal rats. Sergliflozin etabonate also improved postprandial hyperglycemia in neonatal streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; whereas gliclazide did not improve it. In rats with mild or moderate streptozotocin-induced diabetes, the degree of the antihyperglycemic effects of sergliflozin etabonate correlated with the severity of the diabetic condition. Sergliflozin etabonate did not affect the plasma glucose level of normal rats as seen with gliclazide. Chronic treatment with sergliflozin etabonate reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, and improved the glycemic response after glucose loading in Zucker fatty rats. In addition, sergliflozin etabonate did not affect the body weight or food intake. These data indicate that sergliflozin etabonate could improve glycemic control without its use resulting in insulin secretion, hypoglycemia, and body weight gain, and may provide a unique approach to the treatment of diabetes.

19293728|t|D1-like receptors inhibit insulin-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via down-regulation of insulin receptor expression.
19293728|a|OBJECTIVE: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is central to the development of vascular diseases, including hypertension, which is regulated by numerous hormones and humoral factors. Our previous study showed that the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine on VSMC proliferation is inhibited by D1-like receptors and the D3 dopamine receptor, a member of the D2-like receptor family. Insulin is a proliferative hormone but it is not known if there is any interaction between insulin and D1-like receptors. We hypothesized that Dl-like receptors may have an inhibitory effect on the insulin-induced VSMC proliferation; aberrant insulin and Dl-like receptor functions could be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. METHODS: VSMC proliferation was determined by [H]-thymidine incorporation; insulin receptor mRNA and protein expressions were determined by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Insulin increased VSMC proliferation in immortalized aortic A10 cells, determined by [H]-thymidine incorporation. Although the D1-like receptor, by itself, had no effect on VSMC proliferation, stimulation with fenoldopam, a D1-like receptor agonist, inhibited the stimulatory effect of insulin. The inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin-mediated VSMC proliferation was receptor specific, because its effect could be blocked by SCH23390, a D1-like receptor antagonist. Fenoldopam also inhibited insulin receptor mRNA and protein expression, which was time dependent and concentration dependent. A PKC or MAP kinase inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin receptor expression, indicating that PKC and MAP kinase were involved in the signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of D1-like receptors on insulin-mediated VSMC proliferation may play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure.

19399743|t|Successful liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with the anti-complement antibody eculizumab.
19399743|a|Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired hemolytic anemia caused by somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan-complementation class A gene and the resulting absence of a key complement regulatory protein, CD59. Affected red blood cells in patients with PNH undergo intravascular complement-mediated lysis with resulting anemia, hemoglobinuria, and venous thromboses. Hepatic venous outflow thrombosis [Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS)] is especially common in PNH patients and often fatal. The few case reports of outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplant for BCS secondary to PNH detail instances of recurrent BCS as well as early thrombotic portal vein occlusion and hepatic artery thrombosis requiring retransplantation. PNH is therefore generally considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. Here we present the first report of a patient with PNH and BCS undergoing successful liver transplantation while receiving eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the activation of the terminal complement at C5.

19472276|t|Screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors by CE after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet.
19472276|a|In this study the development of a procedure based on capillary electrophoresis after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet methodology for the screening and in vitro evaluation of the biological activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors is presented. The progress of the enzymatic reaction of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine at pH 8 in the presence of AChE and the inhibitor studied is determined by measuring at 230 nm the peak area of the reaction product thiocholine (TCh). In the method employed the capillary was first filled with 30 mM borate-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and subsequently, plugs of: (i) water, (ii) AChE solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) AChE solution, and (v) water, were hydrodynamically injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand (and react) during a waiting period of 2 min. The applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate different kinetic parameters of interest such as inhibition constants K(i), identification of inhibitory action mechanism and IC(50), is evaluated using compounds with known activity, tacrine edrophonium, and neostigmine. The results obtained are compared with bibliographic values and confirm the effectiveness of the methodology proposed. Finally a method for AChE Inhibitor screening is proposed.

19496999|t|Dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex by haloperidol, olanzapine and clozapine.
19496999|a|AIMS: Aberrant dopamine transmission in extrastriatal brain regions has been repeatedly illustrated among patients with schizophrenia. Differences between typical and second-generation antipsychotics in dopamine D(2) receptor modulation within various brain areas remain a topic for debate. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate dopamine D(2/3) receptor apparent binding potential (BP(app)) and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex among clozapine-, olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Dopamine D(2/3) binding was studied on single-photon emission computed tomography ligand [(123)I]epidepride in 13 schizophrenia patients treated with medication (two with haloperidol, four with olanzapine and seven with clozapine), six drug-naive patients and seven healthy controls. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) receptor BP(app) (P = 0.015) and occupancy (P = 0.016) were observed between the clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol groups. The lowest occupancy was found in clozapine-treated patients (5%), followed by olanzapine-treated patients (28%), compared to haloperidol-treated patients (40%). No significant differences were observed in the temporal poles. Occupancy changed substantially depending on the comparison group used (either drug-naive vs healthy controls) in the examined brain areas (P = 0.001), showing an overestimation with all antipsychotics when the healthy control group was used. CONCLUSION: Both typical and second-generation antipsychotics occupy cortical dopamine D(2/3) receptors, thus mediating therapeutic efficacy. Observed differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) occupancy between classical antipsychotics and second-generation antipsychotics may have clinical relevance by modulating altered nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission during the acute phase of schizophrenia.

19651196|t|Medical treatment of acute poisoning with organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides.
19651196|a|Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OP can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure. The mechanism of OP poisoning involves inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leading to inactivation of the enzyme which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the nervous systems. During more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with OP. They act by reactivation of AChE inhibited by OP. However, they differ in their activity in poisoning with pesticides and warfare nerve agents and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OP. In spite of enormous efforts devoted to development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OP only four compounds so far have found its application in human medicine. Presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, AChE reactivator such as one of the recommended pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime and HI-6) and diazepam are used for the treatment of OP poisoning in humans. In this article the available data related to medical treatment of poisoning with OP pesticides are reviewed and the current recommendations are presented.

19837759|t|Preclinical properties of 18F-AV-45: a PET agent for Abeta plaques in the brain.
19837759|a|UNLABELLED: beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta plaques) in the brain, containing predominantly fibrillary Abeta peptide aggregates, represent a defining pathologic feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Imaging agents targeting the Abeta plaques in the living human brain are potentially valuable as biomarkers of pathogenesis processes in AD. (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-(18)F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-methy l benzenamine ((18)F-AV-45) is such as an agent currently in phase III clinical studies for PET of Abeta plaques in the brain. METHODS: In vitro binding of (18)F-AV-45 to Abeta plaques in the postmortem AD brain tissue was evaluated by in vitro binding assay and autoradiography. In vivo biodistribution of (18)F-AV-45 in mice and ex vivo autoradiography of AD transgenic mice (APPswe/PSEN1) with Abeta aggregates in the brain were performed. Small-animal PET of a monkey brain after an intravenous injection of (18)F-AV-45 was evaluated. RESULTS: (18)F-AV-45 displayed a high binding affinity and specificity to Abeta plaques (K(d), 3.72 +/- 0.30 nM). In vitro autoradiography of postmortem human brain sections showed substantial plaque labeling in AD brains and not in the control brains. Initial high brain uptake and rapid washout from the brain of healthy mice and monkey were observed. Metabolites produced in the blood of healthy mice after an intravenous injection were identified. (18)F-AV-45 displayed excellent binding affinity to Abeta plaques in the AD brain by ex vivo autoradiography in transgenic AD model mice. The results lend support that (18)F-AV-45 may be a useful PET agent for detecting Abeta plaques in the living human brain.

19852528|t|Palonosetron: in the prevention of nausea and vomiting.
19852528|a|Palonosetron is a second-generation serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with a distinct pharmacological profile that differs from first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Intravenous palonosetron is widely indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the acute and delayed phases following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). In the US, oral palonosetron is approved for the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following MEC (although this formulation is not currently available), and intravenous palonosetron is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 hours following surgery. All indications are currently limited to adult patients. Intravenous palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous ondansetron (with statistically greater efficacy than ondansetron) or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC, or to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing CINV following HEC, in the acute phase. Statistically greater efficacy was seen with intravenous palonosetron than ondansetron or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC in the delayed phase. Oral palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous palonosetron in preventing CINV in the acute phase in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron was superior to placebo in preventing PONV in the first 24 hours following surgery. Palonosetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Intravenous palonosetron is a valuable option in the prevention of acute- and delayed-phase CINV in adult patients receiving MEC, and of acute-phase CINV in patients receiving HEC. Oral palonosetron is likely to be a useful addition to oral formulations of other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron is a useful alternative to currently recommended agents in PONV prevention.

19888521|t|Structural features of low-molecular-weight heparins affecting their affinity to antithrombin.
19888521|a|As part of a more extensive investigation on structural features of different low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) that can affect their biological activities, Enoxaparin, Tinzaparin and Dalteparin were characterised with regards to the distribution of different chain length oligosaccharides as determined by size-exclusion (SE) chromatography, as well as their structure as defined by 2D-NMR spectra (HSQC). The three LMWHs were also fractionated into high affinity (HA) and no affinity (NA) pools with regards to their ability to bind antithrombin (AT). The HA fractions were further subfractionated and characterised. For the parent LMWHs and selected fractions, molecular weight parameters were measured using a SE chromatographic system with a triple detector (TDA) to obtain absolute molecular weights. The SE chromatograms clearly indicate that Enoxaparin is consistently richer in shorter oligosaccharides than Tinzaparin and Dalteparin. Besides providing the content of terminal groups and individual glucosamine and uronic acid residues with different sulfate substituents, the HSQC-NMR spectra permitted us to evaluate and correlate the content of the pentasaccharide, AT-binding sequence A-G-A*-I-A (AT-bs) through quantification of signals of the disaccharide sequence G-A*. Whereas the percent content of HA species is approximately the same for the three LMWHs, substantial differences were observed for the chain distribution of AT-bs as a function of length, with the AT-bs being preferentially contained in the longest chains of each LMWH. The above information will be useful in establishing structure-activity relationships currently under way. This study is therefore critical for establishing correlations between structural features of LMWHs and their AT-mediated anticoagulant activity.

20053189|t|Abarelix and other gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer.
20053189|a|Hormonal therapy is the main recommended treatment for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, such as buserelin, goserelin, leuprorelin and triptorelin, stimulate the pituitary's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, ultimately leading to its de-sensitization and subsequent reduction of LH and testosterone levels. However, this reduction is accompanied by a well described increase or 'surge' in LH and testosterone levels, necessitating the concomitant administration of an antiandrogen to combat the potential effects of transient acceleration in cancer activity. Two pure GnRH antagonists have been developed, abarelix and degarelix, that are devoid of any agonist effect on the GnRH receptor and consequently do not result in testosterone flare. Abarelix was the first GnRH antagonist to be developed and was approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the initiation of hormonal castration in advanced or metastasizing hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma, when rapid androgen suppression is necessary. Clinical data on both abarelix and degarelix show that they can produce rapid and sustained decreases in testosterone to castrate levels without the need for co-administration of an antiandrogen, and with a very low complication rate in the short term.

20151846|t|Fulvestrant: a unique antiendocrine agent for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer.
20151846|a|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The role of estrogen deprivation for the treatment of breast cancer has been understood since the 1800s. Pharmacologic advances in the field in the past decades, including tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors, have contributed significantly to the reduced mortality of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. However, this subtype of breast cancer still presents with relapses and, once metastatic, progression to hormone-refractory state and loss of disease control remain an expected disease course. Fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor downregulator, is a new addition to the antiestrogen therapeutic armamentarium since its FDA approval in 2002. Its unique mechanism of action offers potential advantages over other estrogen targeted therapies.

20496522|t|Alpha-2B adrenergic receptor mediated hemodynamic profile of etomidate.
20496522|a|Etomidate has been used since 1972 as an inductor and in maintaining anesthesia. There are multiple mechanisms that account for the biologic effects of etomidate. One of the most prominent features of this drug is that it provides anesthesia without gross changes in hemodynamic parameters. This feature allows using etomidate in patients with considerable cardiopulmonary compromise avoiding the characteristic hypotension produced by other anesthetics. The mechanism that provides the basis for its cardiovascular stability is the capacity to bind and stimulate peripheral alpha-2B adrenergic receptors with a subsequent vasoconstriction. Alterations in the function or number of these receptors may account for abnormal responses during etomidate induction.

21207059|t|N-carbamylglutamate treatment for acute neonatal hyperammonemia in isovaleric acidemia.
21207059|a|Hyperammonemia occurs mainly in patients with branched-chain organic acidemias such as propionic, methylmalonic, and isovaleric acidemias. Its pathophysiological process is mainly via the competitive inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. Oral carglumic acid (N-carbamylglutamate) administration can correct hyperammonemia in neonates with propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, thus avoiding dialysis therapy. Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive disease of leucine metabolism due to deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. For the first time, we report a neonate with isovaleric acidemia, whose plasma ammonia concentration dropped dramatically after one oral load of carglumic acid. This experience suggests that carglumic acid could be considered for acute hyperammonemia resulting from isovaleric acidemia. However, trials with more patients are needed.

2125244|t|Stoichiometry of estramustine phosphate binding to MAP2 measured by the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules.
2125244|a|The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.

21606412|t|Activity of XL184 (Cabozantinib), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.
21606412|a|PURPOSE: XL184 (cabozantinib) is a potent inhibitor of MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and RET, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical models. Early observations of clinical benefit in a phase I study of cabozantinib, which included patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), led to expansion of an MTC-enriched cohort, which is the focus of this article. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of oral cabozantinib was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) determination. Additional end points included RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, RET mutational status, and biomarker analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with MTC. The MTD was 175 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), mucositis, and AST, ALT, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction. Ten (29%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response. Overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease. Additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, resulting in SD for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial response in 68% of patients with MTC. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib has an acceptable safety profile and is active in MTC. Cabozantinib may provide clinical benefit by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways of importance in MTC, including MET, VEGFR2, and RET. A global phase III pivotal study in MTC is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00215605).

22258629|t|Toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot (Pakistan).
22258629|a|Chromium is widely used in the leather industry, and tannery workers are under constant threat of adverse health effects due to its excessive exposure. Our objective was to find out the toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot, Pakistan. A total of 240 males consisting of 120 workers from tanneries at Sialkot and equal number of controls were included. Blood complete counts, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde and routine biochemical tests were carried out by routine procedures. Chromium levels in blood (BCr) and urine were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer analyst-200. Results revealed that all the workers were male with average age of 33 years and 15 (13%) had skin rashes, 14 (12%) had chronic bronchitis, 10 (8%) had gastritis and 4 (3%) conjunctivitis. The tannery workers had significantly raised median (interquartile range) of BCr 569 (377-726) nmol/L as compared to 318 (245-397) nmol/L in the control (p < 0.001). Sixty-five (54%) workers had BCr levels above the upper limit set by Agency for Toxic Substance and Drug Registry. The urinary chromium excretion was significantly high in workers 131 (46-312) nmol/L as compared to 13 (3-26) nmol/L in controls (p < 0.01). The workers had hematological, hepatic and renal function impairment because of oxidative stress on body systems. It is concluded that about half of the workers had excessive exposure to chromium in the tanneries at Sialkot. They had significantly raised chromium levels in their biological fluids and adverse health effects due to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory changes.

22287617|t|Protective effect of vitamin E and epicatechin against nicotine-induced oxidative stress in rats.
22287617|a|Nicotine is a major pharmacologically active and addictive component of tobacco smoke, which is regarded to be a primary risk factor in the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human diet. Particularly high levels of this compound are found in tea, apples and chocolate. It has been reported that tea extracts and/or its constituents have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, antitumor and antimutagenic activities. Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and free radical scavenger, presents as an integral component of cellular membranes and has important biological functions. The primary mechanism by which vitamin E is proposed to prevent cancer is through their antioxidant properties. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of epicatechin alone or combined with vitamin E in inhibiting the oxidative stress induced by nicotine in rats. Results obtained indicated that there was a significant elevation in the levels of malondialdhyde (MDA) in nicotine injected rats. The combined treatment (epicatechin + Vit E) group showed a potential reduction of these parameters more than individual treatment. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were found significantly higher in combined treated than untreated rats. In nicotine group, a negative significant correlation between reduced glutathione and MDA (r = -0.92) was observed. In conclusion, these results suggested that the supplementation of diet with epicatechin and vitamin E provided antioxidant defense with strong chemopreventive activity against nicotine-induced carcinogenesis.

22370636|t|Conditional activation of Pik3ca(H1047R) in a knock-in mouse model promotes mammary tumorigenesis and emergence of mutations.
22370636|a|Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110α, occur in ∼25% of human breast cancers. In this study, we report the development of a knock-in mouse model for breast cancer where the endogenous Pik3ca allele was modified to allow tissue-specific conditional expression of a frequently found Pik3ca(H1047R) (Pik3ca(e20H1047R)) mutant allele. We found that activation of the latent Pik3ca(H1047R) allele resulted in breast tumors with multiple histological types. Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3ca(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors identified multiple mutations, including Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors. Further, we used this model to test the efficacy of GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, in clinical development, and showed that the tumors respond to PI3K inhibition.

22447684|t|Quercetin reduces high-fat diet-induced fat accumulation in the liver by regulating lipid metabolism genes.
22447684|a|To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of quercetin on the physiological effects of hyperlipidemia, we investigated its role in the prevention of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and found that it regulated hepatic gene expression related to lipid metabolism. Quercetin supplementation in mice significantly reduced the HFD-induced gains in body weight, liver weight, and white adipose tissue weight compared with the mice fed only with HFD. It also significantly reduced HFD-induced increases in serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglyceride, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS). Consistent with the reduced liver weight and white adipose tissue weight, hepatic lipid accumulation and the size of lipid droplets in the epididymal fat pads were also reduced by quercetin supplementation. To further investigate how quercetin may reduce obesity, we analyzed lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver. Quercetin supplementation altered expression profiles of several lipid metabolism-related genes, including Fnta, Pon1, Pparg, Aldh1b1, Apoa4, Abcg5, Gpam, Acaca, Cd36, Fdft1, and Fasn, relative to those in HFD control mice. The expression patterns of these genes observed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by immunoblot assays. Collectively, our results indicate that quercetin prevents HFD-induced obesity in C57B1/6 mice, and its anti-obesity effects may be related to the regulation of lipogenesis at the level of transcription.

22469981|t|In vivo and in vitro models for the therapeutic targeting of Wnt signaling using a Tet-OΔN89β-catenin system.
22469981|a|Although significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of Wnt signaling in the initiation of colorectal cancer, less is known about responses that accompany the reversal of oncogenic Wnt signaling. The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro responses to an 'ideal' Wnt pathway inhibitor as a model for the therapeutic targeting of the pathway. A tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated β-catenin (ΔN89β-catenin) that exhibited a strong intestinal hyperplasia was analyzed during the removal of oncogenic β-catenin expression both in 3D 'crypt culture' and in vivo. Oncogenic Wnt signaling was rapidly and completely reversed. The strongest inhibition of Wnt target gene expression occurred within 24 h of doxycycline removal at which time the target genes Ascl2, Axin2 and C-myc were downregulated to levels below that in the control intestine. In vitro, the small molecule Wnt inhibitor CCT036477 induced a response within 4 h of treatment. By 7 days following doxycycline withdrawal, gene expression, cell proliferation and tissue morphology were undistinguishable from control animals.In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should ideally be studied within hours of treatment. The reversible system described, involving medium throughput in vitro approaches and rapid in vivo responses, should allow the rapid advance of early stage compounds into efficacy models that are more usually considered later in the drug discovery pipeline.

22578098|t|Discovery and structural characterization of a phospholamban-binding cyclic peptide and design of novel inhibitors of phospholamban.
22578098|a|The interplay between cardiac sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase and phospholamban is a key regulating factor of contraction and relaxation in the cardiac muscle. In heart failure, aberrations in the inhibition of sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase by phospholamban are associated with anomalies in cardiac functions. In experimental heart failure models, modulation of the interaction between these two proteins has been shown to be a potential therapeutic approach. The aim of our research was to find molecules able to interfere with the inhibitory activity of phospholamban on sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)ATPase. For this purpose, a portion of phospholamban was synthesized and used as target for a phage-display peptide library screening. The cyclic peptide C-Y-W-E-L-E-W-L-P-C-A was found to bind to phospholamban (1-36) with high specificity. Its functional activity was tested in Ca(2+)uptake assays utilizing preparations from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. By synthesizing and testing a series of alanine point-mutated cyclic peptides, we identified which amino acid was important for the inhibition of the phospholamban function. The structures of active and inactive alanine-mutated cyclic peptides, and of phospholamban (1-36), were determined by NMR. This structure-activity analysis allowed building a model of phospholamban -cyclic peptide complex. Thereafter, a simple pharmacophore was defined and used for the design of small molecules. Finally, examples of such molecules were synthesized and characterized as phospholamban inhibitors.

22614014|t|Macrophage cathepsin K promotes prostate tumor progression in bone.
22614014|a|Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) share common progenitors with osteoclasts and are critical components of bone-tumor microenvironment; however, their function in prostate tumor growth in the skeleton has not been explored. BMMs are the major source of inflammatory factors and proteases, including cysteine protease cathepsin K (CTSK). In this study, utilizing mice deficient in CTSK, we demonstrate the critical involvement of this potent collagenase in tumor progression in bone. We present the evidence that tumor growth and progression in the bone are impaired in the absence of CTSK. Most importantly, we show for the first time that BMM-supplied CTSK may be involved in CCL2- and COX-2-driven pathways that contribute to tumor progression in bone. Together, our data unravel novel roles for CTSK in macrophage-regulated processes, and provide evidence for close interplay between inflammatory, osteolytic and tumor cell-driven events in the bone-tumor microenvironment.

22677475|t|Effect of tetrabrombisphenol A on induction of apoptosis in the testes and changes in expression of selected testicular genes in CD1 mice.
22677475|a|Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a substance widely used in industry as a flame retardant. TBBPA was found in the environment and was detected even in the human body. The effect of this chemical was observed in different cell lines in vitro and it is supposed that TBBPA may affect various hormonal systems in vivo. In this study we examined the effect of TBBPA on the reproductive parameters of two generations of outbred mice in vivo. Experimental and control animals of F1 generation were bred in various conditions to enable evaluation of the possible trans-generational effect. An increased incidence of apoptosis in the testes and changes in the morphometry of seminiferous tubules was detected in the experimental animals. In addition, changes in the expression pattern of selected genes encoding proteins that play an important role during spermatogenesis were observed. In contrast, sperm quality and reproduction were not affected by TBBPA.

2268554|t|Inhibitory effect of synthetic progestins, 4-MA and cyanoketone on human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene-isomerase activity.
2268554|a|Human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-HSD) purified from human placenta transforms C-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as C-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Trilostane, epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD with Ki values of approximately 50 nM. 4-MA, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-HSD with a Ki value of 56 nM. Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.

22709946|t|Enhanced mGlu5-receptor dependent long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse of congenitally learned helpless rats.
22709946|a|Alterations of the glutamatergic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depression. In order to investigate the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in an animal model for treatment-resistant depression we used rats bred for congenital learned helplessness (cLH) and the control strain, bred for resistance against inescapable stress, congenitally. not learned helpless rats (cNLH). Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of mGlu5 (but not mGlu1a) receptors in the hippocampus of cLH rats, as compared with control cNLH rats. We also examined mGlu1/5 receptor signaling by in vivo measurement of DHPG-stimulated polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis. Stimulation of (3)H-inositolmonophosphate formation induced by i.c.v. injection of DHPG was enhanced by about 50% in the hippocampus of cLH rats. Correspondingly, DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral/CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was amplified in hippocampal slices of cLH rats, whereas LTD induced by low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals did not change. Moreover, these effects were associated with decreased basal dendritic spine density of CA1 pyramidal cell in cLH rats. These data raise the attractive possibility that changes in the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in the hippocampus might underlie the changes in synaptic plasticity associated with the depressive-like phenotype of cLH rats. However, chronic treatment of cLH rats with MPEP did not reverse learned helplessness, indicating that the enhanced mGlu5 receptor function is not the only player in the behavioral phenotype of this genetic model of depression.

22722028|t|Deep brain stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors and glutamatergic drugs rescue resistance to fear extinction in a genetic mouse model.
22722028|a|Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent, excessive fear. Therapeutic interventions that reverse deficits in fear extinction represent a tractable approach to treating these disorders. We previously reported that 129S1/SvImJ (S1) mice show no extinction learning following normal fear conditioning. We now demonstrate that weak fear conditioning does permit fear reduction during massed extinction training in S1 mice, but reveals specific deficiency in extinction memory consolidation/retrieval. Rescue of this impaired extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with d-cycloserine (N-methly-d-aspartate partial agonist) or MS-275 (histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), applied after extinction training. We next examined the ability of different drugs and non-pharmacological manipulations to rescue the extreme fear extinction deficit in S1 following normal fear conditioning with the ultimate aim to produce low fear levels in extinction retrieval tests. Results showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) by applying high frequency stimulation to the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) during extinction training, indeed significantly reduced fear during extinction retrieval compared to sham stimulation controls. Rescue of both impaired extinction acquisition and deficient extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with prior extinction training administration of valproic acid (a GABAergic enhancer and HDAC inhibitor) or AMN082 [metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) agonist], while MS-275 or PEPA (AMPA receptor potentiator) failed to affect extinction acquisition in S1 mice. Collectively, these data identify potential beneficial effects of DBS and various drug treatments, including those with HDAC inhibiting or mGlu7 agonism properties, as adjuncts to overcome treatment resistance in exposure-based therapies.

22749926|t|Nicotine facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning.
22749926|a|Perceptual learning is a special type of non-declarative learning that involves experience-dependent plasticity in sensory cortices. The cholinergic system is known to modulate declarative learning. In particular, reduced levels or efficacy of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine were found to facilitate declarative memory consolidation. However, little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in memory consolidation of non-declarative learning. Here we compared two groups of non-smoking men who learned a visual texture discrimination task (TDT). One group received chewing tobacco containing nicotine for 1 h directly following the TDT training. The other group received a similar tasting control substance without nicotine. Electroencephalographic recordings during substance consumption showed reduced alpha activity and P300 latencies in the nicotine group compared to the control group. When re-tested on the TDT the following day, both groups responded more accurately and more rapidly than during training. These improvements were specific to the retinal location and orientation of the texture elements of the TDT suggesting that learning involved early visual cortex. A group comparison showed that learning effects were more pronounced in the nicotine group than in the control group. These findings suggest that oral consumption of nicotine enhances the efficacy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings further suggest that enhanced efficacy of the cholinergic system facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning (and possibly other types of non-declarative learning). In that regard acetylcholine seems to affect consolidation processes in perceptual learning in a different manner than in declarative learning. Alternatively, our findings might reflect dose-dependent cholinergic modulation of memory consolidation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

22798247|t|Increased expression of P450scc and CYP17 in development of endogenous hyperandrogenism in a rat model of PCOS.
22798247|a|The objective of the present study was to characterize the effect of insulin plus hCG on the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (P450scc and CYP17) in polycystic ovaries of rats. Changes in estrous cycle, ovarian morphology, hormonal levels, and protein levels by immunohistochemistry and western-blot were determined. Rats treated with insulin plus hCG displayed abnormal estrous cycles with increasing androgen biosynthesis. Meanwhile, insulin plus hCG resulted in multiple large cysts with diminished granulosa layers and increased thecal layers and stromal-interstitial tissue. Moreover, there was an increase in the expression of P450scc and CYP17 in thecal and stromal cells in our PCOS rat model compared with control rats. These results indicate that administration of insulin with hCG can synergistically result in endogenous hyperandrogenism which may partially upregulate the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in ovarian tissue.

22889582|t|Can the chemical reactivity of an ultimate carcinogen be related to its carcinogenicity? An application to propylene oxide.
22889582|a|In this article we report calculations of the activation free energy for a chemical reaction between propylene oxide and DNA, in particular with the guanine at the N7 position. Calculations were performed using Hartree-Fock and MP2 methods in conjunction with flexible basis sets. The effects of solvation were considered using the Langevin dipoles and solvent reaction field methods. The calculated activation free energies are in good agreement with the experimental value of 25.36 kcal/mol. Moreover, the reactivities of a series of ultimate carcinogens of the epoxy type toward DNA are shown to be related to their carcinogenicities. Higher reactivity is generally associated with higher carcinogenicity, although transport properties, reactions with ultimate carcinogen scavengers, and the DNA correction mechanism are also very important. It is very likely that the window of reactivity rather than a high reactivity value is the relevant measure of carcinogenicity, since highly reactive ultimate carcinogens interact with water and proteins before they reach DNA.

22893351|t|A significant dose-dependent relationship between mercury exposure from dental amalgams and kidney integrity biomarkers: A further assessment of the Casa Pia children's dental amalgam trial.
22893351|a|Dental amalgams are a commonly used dental restorative material. Amalgams are about 50% mercury (Hg), and Hg is known to significantly accumulate in the kidney. It was hypothesized that because Hg accumulates in the proximal tubules (PTs), glutathione-S-transferases (GST)-α (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of PT) would be expected to be more related to Hg exposure than GST-π (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of the distal tubules). Urinary biomarkers of kidney integrity were examined in children of 8-18 years old, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study). Our study determined whether there was a significant dose-dependent correlation between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and GST-α and GST-π as biomarkers of kidney integrity. Overall, the present study, using a different and more sensitive statistical model than the parent study, revealed a statistically significant dose-dependent correlation between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary levels of GST-α, after covariate adjustment; where as, a nonsignificant relationship was observed with urinary levels of GST-π. Furthermore, it was observed that urinary GST-α levels increased by about 10% over the 8-year course of the study among individuals with an average exposure to amalgams among the study subjects from the amalgam group, in comparison with study subjects with no exposure to dental amalgams. The results of our study suggest that dental amalgams contribute to ongoing kidney damage at the level of the PTs in a dose-dependent fashion.

22923473|t|Liver glycogen loading dampens glycogen synthesis seen in response to either hyperinsulinemia or intraportal glucose infusion.
22923473|a|The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of liver glycogen loading on net hepatic glycogen synthesis during hyperinsulinemia or hepatic portal vein glucose infusion in vivo. Liver glycogen levels were supercompensated (SCGly) in two groups (using intraportal fructose infusion) but not in two others (Gly) during hyperglycemic-normoinsulinemia. Following a 2-h control period during which fructose infusion was stopped, there was a 2-h experimental period in which the response to hyperglycemia plus either 4× basal insulin (INS) or portal vein glucose infusion (PoG) was measured. Increased hepatic glycogen reduced the percent of glucose taken up by the liver that was deposited in glycogen (74 ± 3 vs. 53 ± 5% in Gly+INS and SCGly+INS, respectively, and 72 ± 3 vs. 50 ± 6% in Gly+PoG and SCGly+PoG, respectively). The reduction in liver glycogen synthesis in SCGly+INS was accompanied by a decrease in both insulin signaling and an increase in AMPK activation, whereas only the latter was observed in SCGly+PoG. These data indicate that liver glycogen loading impairs glycogen synthesis regardless of the signal used to stimulate it.

22943130|t|Quantitation of UGT1A1 in human liver microsomes using stable isotope-labelled peptides and mass spectrometry based proteomic approaches.
22943130|a|1. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are a group of drug-metabolizing enzymes that catalyse the conjugation of endogeonous compounds and xenobiotics to yield hydrophilic glucuronides which subsequently undergo excretion. This report describes an approach for the identification and accurate quantitation of human UGT1A1 in complex biological matrices using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of protein digests. 2. A stable isotope-labelled (SIL) peptide of a unique peptide spanning residues 54-69 in exon 1 of the human UGT1A1 protein with the sequence RIYLSADPALVVIEHG was synthesized. The peptide sequence synthesized was in the reverse order of the human peptide with the stable isotope-labels in the amino acid arginine ((13)C6(15)N4) resulting in an increase in the mass of the SIL peptide of 10 amu, from 1753 to 1763. The SIL peptide was quantitated by injecting increasing concentrations of the peptide into the LC-MS to obtain a standard curve. 3. The labelled peptide along with precursor ion monitoring was used to quantify the levels of UGT1A1 in commercial recombinant preparations (supersomes) and individual human liver microsomal samples and pooled human liver micrsomes obtained from BD Biosciences. 4. Glucuronidation activity studies were performed, which demonstrated a positive correlation between enzyme activity levels and the UGT1A1 content in the liver microsomes obtained from individual human donors.

22956632|t|Toxicity profile of small-molecule IAP antagonist GDC-0152 is linked to TNF-α pharmacology.
22956632|a|Inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress apoptosis and are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Small-molecule IAP antagonists are currently being tested in clinical trials as novel cancer therapeutics. GDC-0152 is a small-molecule drug that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing IAPs. GDC-0152 induces NF-κB transcriptional activity leading to expression of several chemokines and cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is the most important for single-agent tumor activity. TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives a variety of cellular responses, comprising inflammation, proliferation, and cell survival or death depending on the cellular context. As malignant and normal cells produce TNF-α upon IAP antagonism, increased TNF-α could drive both efficacy and toxicity. The toxicity profile of GDC-0152 in dogs and rats was characterized after iv dose administration once every 2 weeks for four doses. Findings in both species consisted of a dose-related, acute, systemic inflammatory response, and hepatic injury. Laboratory findings included elevated plasma cytokines, an inflammatory leukogram, and increased liver transaminases with histopathological findings of inflammatory infiltrates and apoptosis/necrosis in multiple tissues; a toxicology profile consistent with TNF-α-mediated toxicity. Dogs exhibited more severe findings than rats, and humans did not exhibit these findings, at comparable exposures across species. Furthermore, elevations in blood neutrophil count, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and other markers of inflammation corresponded to GDC-0152 exposure and toxicity and thus may have utility as safety biomarkers.

22966070|t|Tub has a key role in insulin and leptin signaling and action in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei.
22966070|a|Mutation of tub gene in mice induces obesity, suggesting that tub could be an important regulator of energy balance. In the current study, we investigated whether insulin, leptin, and obesity can modulate Tub in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei, and we investigated possible consequences on energy balance, neuropeptide expression, and hepatic glucose metabolism. Food intake, metabolic characteristics, signaling proteins, and neuropeptide expression were measured in response to fasting and refeeding, intracerebroventricular insulin and leptin, and Tub antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Tub tyrosine phosphorylation (Tub-p-tyr) is modulated by nutritional status. Tub is a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK) and leptin receptor (LEPR)-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in hypothalamic nuclei. After leptin or insulin stimulation, Tub translocates to the nucleus. Inhibition of Tub expression in hypothalamus by ASO increased food intake, fasting blood glucose, and hepatic glucose output, decreased O(2) consumption, and blunted the effect of insulin or leptin on proopiomelanocortin, thyroid-releasing hormone, melanin-concentrating hormone, and orexin expression. In hypothalamus of mice administered a high-fat diet, there is a reduction in leptin and insulin-induced Tub-p-tyr and nuclear translocation, which is reversed by reducing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B expression. These results indicate that Tub has a key role in the control of insulin and leptin effects on food intake, and the modulation of Tub may contribute to insulin and leptin resistance in DIO mice.

22982218|t|The PARP inhibitor PJ34 modifies proliferation, NIS expression and epigenetic marks in thyroid cancer cell lines.
22982218|a|Since PARP-1 is supposed to be part of a multimeric repressor of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression, in this study the effect of the PARP inhibitor PJ34 on several properties of thyroid cancer cell lines was investigated. In TPC1, BCPAP, FRO, WRO cell lines PJ34 induced a strong increase in NIS mRNA levels. In BCPAP and TPC1 cells also significant increase of radio-iodine uptake was induced. Accordingly, in transfection experiments performed in TPC1 cells, treatment with PJ34 increased NIS promoter activity without affecting PARP-1 binding to the promoter sequence. We also investigated the epigenetic status of NIS promoter after PJ34 treatment in TPC1 cell line: in addition to an increase of histone modification activation marks (H3K9K14ac, H3K4me3), surprisingly we observed also an increase of H3K27me3, a classical repressive mark. Our data demonstrate that in various thyroid cancer cell lines PARP inhibition increases NIS gene expression through a particular modulation of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we suggest that PARP inhibitors may deserve future investigations as tools for medical treatment of thyroid cancer.

22989703|t|Comparative antioxidant effects of lycopene, apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in human macrophages exposed to H2O2 and cigarette smoke extract.
22989703|a|Much of the beneficial effects of tomato lycopene in the prevention of chronic diseases has been attributed to its antioxidant properties, which could be mediated by its metabolites and/or oxidation products. However, the biological functions of these lycopene derivatives remain still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated and compared the antioxidant efficacy of the lycopene eccentric cleavage products apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in counteracting the oxidative effects of H(2)O(2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in THP-1 macrophages. Both apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid were able to inhibit spontaneous and H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. Such an effect was accompanied by an inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation, by NF-κB inactivation, and by inhibition of hsp-70 and hsp-90 expressions. Both apo-lycopenoic acids also decreased CSE-induced ROS production, 8-OHdG formation and reduced the increase in NOX-4 and COX-2 expressions caused by CSE. However, in both the models of oxidative stress, apo-14'-lycopenoic acid was much more potent as an antioxidant than apo-10'-lycopenoic acid, showing antioxidant properties similar to lycopene. These data strongly suggest that apo-lycopenoic acids, and particularly apo-14'-lycopenoic acid, may mediate some of the antioxidant functions of lycopene in cells.

23000451|t|Plants as a source of butyrylcholinesterase variants designed for enhanced cocaine hydrolase activity.
23000451|a|Cocaine addiction affects millions of people with disastrous personal and social consequences. Cocaine is one of the most reinforcing of all drugs of abuse, and even those who undergo rehabilitation and experience long periods of abstinence have more than 80% chance of relapse. Yet there is no FDA-approved treatment to decrease the likelihood of relapse in rehabilitated addicts. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated a promising potential treatment option with the help of the serum enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which is capable of breaking down naturally occurring (-)-cocaine before the drug can influence the reward centers of the brain or affect other areas of the body. This activity of wild-type (WT) BChE, however, is relatively low. This prompted the design of variants of BChE which exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity against (-)-cocaine. Plants are a promising means to produce large amounts of these cocaine hydrolase variants of BChE, cheaply, safely with no concerns regarding human pathogens and functionally equivalent to enzymes derived from other sources. Here, in expressing cocaine-hydrolyzing mutants of BChE in Nicotiana benthamiana using the MagnICON virus-assisted transient expression system, and in reporting their initial biochemical analysis, we provide proof-of-principle that plants can express engineered BChE proteins with desired properties.

23000507|t|Experimental tooth movement-induced osteoclast activation is regulated by sympathetic signaling.
23000507|a|Experimental tooth movement (ETM) changes the distribution of sensory nerve fibers in periodontal ligament and the bone architecture through the stimulation of bone remodeling. As the sympathetic nervous system is involved in bone remodeling, we examined whether ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling or not. In male mice, elastic rubber was inserted between upper left first molar (M1) and second molar (M2) for 3 or 5 days. Nerve fibers immunoreactive for not only sensory neuromarkers, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), but also sympathetic neuromarkers, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were increased in the periodontal ligament during ETM. To elucidate the effect of the sympathetic signal mediated by ETM, mice were intraperitoneally injected with a β-antagonist, propranolol (PRO: 20 μg/g/day), or a β-agonist, isoproterenol (ISO: 5 μg/g/day) from 7 days before ETM. PRO treatment suppressed the amount of tooth movement by 12.9% in 3-day ETM and by 32.2% in 5-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment. On the other hand, ISO treatment increased it. Furthermore, ETM remarkably increased the osteoclast number on the bone surface (alveolar socket) (Oc.N/BS) in all drug treatments. PRO treatment suppressed Oc.N/BS by 39.4% in 3-day ETM, while ISO treatment increased it by 32.1% in 3-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment. Chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA: 250 μg/g) showed results similar to those for PRO treatment in terms of both the amount of tooth movement and osteoclast parameters. Our data showed that blockade of sympathetic signaling inhibited the tooth movement and osteoclast increase induced by ETM, and stimulation of sympathetic signaling accelerated these responses. These data suggest that the mechano-adaptive response induced by ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling through osteoclast activation.

23002036|t|Resistin knockout mice exhibit impaired adipocyte glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) expression.
23002036|a|Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone that also plays a regulatory role in fat metabolism. In 3T3-L1 cells, resistin was demonstrated to be a key mediator of GIP stimulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, involving activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and reduced phosphorylation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The current study was initiated to determine whether resistin has additional roles in GIP-regulated adipocyte functions. Analysis of primary adipocytes isolated from Retn(-/-), Retn(+/-), and Retn(+/+) mice found that GIP stimulated the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL pathway and fatty acid uptake only in Retn(+/+) adipocytes, suggesting that GIP signaling and/or GIP responsiveness were compromised in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes. GIP receptor (GIPR) protein and mRNA were decreased in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes, but resistin treatment rescued LPL responsiveness to GIP. In addition, genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), and the signaling proteins stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), were downregulated, and phosphorylated levels of SAPK/JNK/c-Jun were decreased in Retn(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-response element (TRE-III) responsible for c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation of Gipr. Blunted GIP responsiveness in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes was therefore largely due to the greatly reduced GIPR expression associated with decreased c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation of Gipr.

23008503|t|Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 both play an important role in the protection of the duodenal mucosa in cats.
23008503|a|Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs often cause ulcers in the duodenum in humans, the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers has not been fully elucidated. We examined in cats the 1) ulcerogenic effects of selective COX-1 (SC-560, ketorolac) and COX-2 (celecoxib, meloxicam) inhibitors on the gastrointestinal mucosa, 2) effect of feeding and cimetidine on the expression of COX isoforms and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) level in the duodenum, and 3) localization of COX isoforms in the duodenum. COX inhibitors were administered after the morning meal in cats once daily for 3 days. Gastrointestinal lesions were examined on day 4. Localization and expression of COX isoforms (by immunohistochemistry, Western blot) and PGE(2) level (by enzyme immunoassay) were examined. Results were as follows. First, selective COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors alone produced marked ulcers in the duodenum but did not cause obvious lesions in the small intestine. Coadministration of SC-560 and celecoxib produced marked lesions in the small intestine. Second, feeding increased both the expression of COX isoforms and PGE(2) level in the duodenum, and the effects were markedly inhibited by pretreatment with cimetidine. Third, COX-1 was localized in goblet and Brunner's gland cells, Meissner's and Auerbach's plexus, smooth muscle cells, and arterioles; and COX-2 was observed in capillaries, venules, and basal granulated cells. The expression of COX isoforms in the duodenum is up-regulated by feeding, and inhibition of either COX-1 or COX-2 causes ulcers in the duodenum, suggesting that both isoforms play an important role in the protection of the duodenal mucosa.

23019137|t|Reversal of dopamine D2 agonist-induced inhibition of ventral tegmental area neurons by Gq-linked neurotransmitters is dependent on protein kinase C, G protein-coupled receptor kinase, and dynamin.
23019137|a|Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area are important components of brain pathways related to addiction. Prolonged exposure of these neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine (DA) decreases their sensitivity to inhibition by DA, a process called DA-inhibition reversal (DIR). DIR is mediated by phospholipase C and conventional subtype of protein kinase C (cPKC) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1-like DA receptors, or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of 5-HT(2) or neurotensin receptors. In the present study, we further characterized this phenomenon by use of extracellular recordings in brain slices to examine whether DIR is linked to G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) or dynamin by assessing DIR in the presence of antagonists of these enzymes. DIR was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor, which inhibits GRK2, and by dynasore, which blocks dynamin. Reversal of inhibition by D2 agonist quinpirole was produced by serotonin (50 µM) and by neurotensin (5-10 nM). Serotonin-induced or neurotensin-induced reversal was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor, dynasore, or cPKC antagonist 5,6,7,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile (Gö6976). This further characterization of DIR indicates that cPKC, GRK2, and dynamin play important roles in the desensitization of D2 receptors. As drugs of abuse produce persistent increases in DA concentration in the ventral tegmental area, reduction of D2 receptor sensitivity as a result of drug abuse may be a critical factor in the processes of addiction.

23042952|t|Differential cell-protective function of two resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) glucosides against oxidative stress.
23042952|a|Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene; RSV), a natural polyphenol, exerts a beneficial effect on health and diseases. RSV targets and activates the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1; in turn, SIRT1 induces an intracellular antioxidative mechanism by inducing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2). Most RSV found in plants is glycosylated, and the effect of these glycosylated forms on SIRT1 has not been studied. In this study, we compared the effects of RSV and two glycosyl RSVs, resveratrol-3-O-β-d-glucoside (3G-RSV; polydatin/piceid) and resveratrol-4'-O-β-d-glucoside (4'G-RSV), at the cellular level. In oxygen radical absorbance capacity and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assays, the antioxidant activity of 3G-RSV was comparable to that of RSV, whereas the radical-scavenging efficiency of 4'G-RSV was less than 50% of that of RSV. However, 4'G-RSV, but not 3G-RSV, induced SIRT1-dependent histone H3 deacetylation and SOD2 expression in mouse C2C12 skeletal myoblasts; as with RSV, SIRT1 knockdown blunted these effects. RSV and 4'G-RSV, but not 3G-RSV, mitigated oxidative stress-induced cell death in C2C12 cells and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. RSV and 4'G-RSV inhibited C2C12 cell proliferation, but 3G-RSV did not. RSV was found in both the intracellular and extracellular fractions of C2C12 cells that had been incubated with 4'G-RSV, indicating that 4'G-RSV was extracellularly deglycosylated to RSV, which was then taken up by the cells. C2C12 cells did not deglycosylate 3G-RSV. Our results point to 4'G-RSV as a useful RSV prodrug with high water solubility. These data also show that the in vitro antioxidative activity of these molecules did not correlate with their ability to protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.

By simulated annealing analysis and molecular dynamics modeling, two hydrophobic amino acids, F-18 and W-21, in the hinge region were predicted to be relatively surface-exposed and to interact with the aqueous solvent. Using a series of 5A peptide analogs in which F-18 or W-21 was changed to either F, W, A, or E, only peptides with hydrophobic amino acids in these two positions were able to readily bind and solubilize phospholipid vesicles. Compared with active peptides containing F or W, peptides containing E in either of these two positions were more than 10-fold less effective in effluxing cholesterol by the ABCA1 transporter. Intravenous injection of 5A in C57BL/6 mice increased plasma-free cholesterol (5A: 89.9 ± 13.6 mg/dl; control: 38.7 ± 4.3 mg/dl (mean ± S.D.); P < 0.05) and triglycerides (5A: 887.0 ± 172.0 mg/dl; control: 108.9 ± 9.9 mg/dl; P < 0.05), whereas the EE peptide containing E in both positions had no effect. Finally, 5A increased cholesterol efflux approximately 2.5-fold in vivo from radiolabeled macrophages, whereas the EE peptide was inactive. These results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the ABCA1 transporter during the cholesterol efflux process.

23042954|t|Efficacy of the GluK1/AMPA receptor antagonist LY293558 against seizures and neuropathology in a soman-exposure model without pretreatment and its pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration.
23042954|a|Control of brain seizures after exposure to nerve agents is imperative for the prevention of brain damage and death. Animal models of nerve agent exposure make use of pretreatments, or medication administered within 1 minute after exposure, in order to prevent rapid death from peripheral toxic effects and respiratory failure, which then allows the testing of anticonvulsant compounds. However, in a real-case scenario of an unexpected attack with nerve agents, pretreatment would not be possible, and medical assistance may not be available immediately. To determine if control of seizures and survival are still possible without pretreatment or immediate pharmacologic intervention, we studied the anticonvulsant efficacy of the GluK1 (GluR5)/α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY293558) in rats that did not receive any treatment until 20 minutes after exposure to the nerve agent soman. We injected LY293558 intramuscularly, as this would be the most likely route of administration to humans. LY293558 (15 mg/kg), injected along with atropine and the oxime HI-6 at 20 minutes after soman exposure, stopped seizures and increased survival rate from 64% to 100%. LY293558 also prevented neuronal loss in the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced neurodegeneration in a number of brain regions studied 7 days after soman exposure. Analysis of the LY293558 pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration showed that this compound readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There was good correspondence between the time course of seizure suppression by LY293558 and the brain levels of the compound.

23044709|t|Overexpression of H1 calponin in osteoblast lineage cells leads to a decrease in bone mass by disrupting osteoblast function and promoting osteoclast formation.
23044709|a|H1 calponin (CNN1) is known as a smooth muscle-specific, actin-binding protein which regulates smooth muscle contractive activity. Although previous studies have shown that CNN1 has effect on bone, the mechanism is not well defined. To investigate the role of CNN1 in maintaining bone homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing Cnn1 under the control of the osteoblast-specific 3.6-kb Col1a1 promoter. Col1a1-Cnn1 transgenic mice showed delayed bone formation at embryonic stage and decreased bone mass at adult stage. Morphology analyses showed reduced trabecular number, thickness and defects in bone formation. The proliferation and migration of osteoblasts were decreased in Col1a1-Cnn1 mice due to alterations in cytoskeleton. The early osteoblast differentiation of Col1a1-Cnn1 mice was increased, but the late stage differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts derived from Col1a1-Cnn1 mice were significantly decreased. In addition to impaired bone formation, the decreased bone mass was also associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining revealed increased osteoclast numbers in tibias of 2-month-old Col1a1-Cnn1 mice, and increased numbers of osteoclasts co-cultured with Col1a1-Cnn1 osteoblasts. The ratio of RANKL to OPG was significantly increased in Col1a1-Cnn1 osteoblasts. These findings reveal a novel function of CNN1 in maintaining bone homeostasis by coupling bone formation to bone resorption.

23047022|t|Characterisation of acetylcholinesterase release from neuronal cells.
23047022|a|Although acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily a hydrolytic enzyme, metabolising the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, it also has some non-catalytic functions in the brain which are far less well characterised. AChE was shown to be secreted or shed from the neuronal cell surface like several other membrane proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Since AChE does not possess a transmembrane domain, its anchorage in the membrane is established via the Proline Rich Membrane Anchor (PRiMA), a transmembrane protein. Both the subunit oligomerisation and membrane anchor of AChE are shared by a related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the physiological function of which in the brain is unclear. In this work, we have assayed the relative activities of AChE and BChE in membrane fractions and culture medium of three different neuronal cell lines, namely the neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and NB7 and the mouse basal forebrain cell line SN56. In an effort to understand the shedding process of AChE, we have used several pharmacological treatments, which showed that it is likely to be mediated in part by an EDTA- and batimastat-sensitive, but GM6001-insensitive metalloprotease, with the possible additional involvement of a thiol isomerase. Cellular release of AChE by SH-SY5Y is significantly enhanced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists carbachol or muscarine, with the effect of carbachol blocked by the mAChR antagonist atropine. AChE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and it has been shown that it accelerates formation and increases toxicity of amyloid fibrils, which have been closely linked to the pathology of AD. In light of this, greater understanding of AChE and BChE physiology may also benefit AD research.

23047828|t|Circulating very-low-density lipoprotein from subjects with impaired glucose tolerance accelerates adrenocortical cortisol and aldosterone synthesis.
23047828|a|Apart from their role in cardiovascular homeostasis and immunomodulation, aldosterone and cortisol are also implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, glycoxidative modifications of lipoproteins are increasingly recognized as an etiological factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prediabetic individuals. The causative relationship between in vivo lipoprotein modifications and steroidogenesis in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), however, is not well defined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of in vivo modified lipoproteins on aldosterone and cortisol release from human adrenocortical H295R cells. Following an oral glucose tolerance test, 20 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 20 IGT subjects were randomly selected from the ongoing PRAEDIAS prevention study in our department. Cells were incubated for 24 h with lipoproteins isolated from NGT and IGT individuals and aldosterone and cortisol release was measured in the supernatants. VLDL induced a greater stimulating effect on adrenocortical aldosterone and cortisol release compared to HDL and LDL. Moreover, IGT-VLDL evoked a significantly higher effect (p<0.05) on hormone release than NGT-VLDL. Incubation of cells with in vitro modified lipoproteins and specific pharmacological inhibitors suggests that VLDL presumably recruits ERK1/2 as one of the downstream effectors of Jak-2. In summary, in vivo modified VLDL are able to promote prediabetic hormonal dysregulation by modulating adrenocortical steroidogenesis via Jak-2-ERK dependent pathway.

The latter association is intensively disputed, as L-BMAA concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food. The question thus was raised whether L-BMAA leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, L-BMAA-transport, incorporation into proteins, and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated. Binding of L-BMAA to intracellular proteins, but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)C-L-BMAA exposures. Nevertheless, low L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 0.1mM, 48 h) increased protein ubiquitination, 20S proteasomal and caspase 12 activity, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker CHOP, and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, high L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 1mM, 48 h) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization, which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin E. L-BMAA-mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mM L-BMAA treatment. Consequently, the data presented here suggest that low L-BMAA concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing ER stress that is independent from high-concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Thus, the latter could be a contributing factor in the onset and slow progression of ALS/PDC in Guam.

23050902|t|Ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion activates transcription elongation in coagulation factor VII gene expression.
23050902|a|Coagulation FVII (Factor VII) is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized in hepatocytes. It was reported previously that FVII gene (F7) expression was up-regulated by ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus-infected haemophilia patients; however, its precise mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of ribavirin-induced up-regulation of F7 expression in HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line). We found that intracellular GTP depletion by ribavirin as well as other IMPDH (inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, up-regulated F7 expression. FVII mRNA transcription was mainly enhanced by accelerated transcription elongation, which was mediated by the P-TEFb (positive-transcription elongation factor b) complex, rather than by promoter activation. Ribavirin unregulated ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia) 3 mRNA expression before F7 up-regulation. We observed that ribavirin enhanced ELL3 recruitment to F7, whereas knockdown of ELL3 diminished ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation. Ribavirin also enhanced recruitment of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) and AFF4 to F7. These data suggest that ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion recruits a super elongation complex containing P-TEFb, AFF4 and ELL3, to F7, and modulates FVII mRNA transcription elongation. Collectively, we have elucidated a basal mechanism for ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation by acceleration of transcription elongation, which may be crucial in understanding its pleiotropic functions in vivo.

23052195|t|Neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor knockdown can modify glutathione peroxidase and c-AMP response element-binding protein in phenylpropanolamine-treated rats.
23052195|a|It has been reported that antioxidative enzymes, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and c-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are involved in regulating phenylpropanolamine (PPA)-mediated appetite suppression. Here, we investigated whether Y1 receptor (Y1R) might be involved in this regulation. Rats were daily treated with PPA for 4 days. Changes in the contents of NPY, Y1R, glutathione peroxidase (GP), and CREB were assessed and compared. Results showed that Y1R, GP, and CREB increased, with a maximal increase about 100, 200, and 150 %, respectively, on Day 2. By contrast, NPY decreased with a biggest reduction about 48 % on Day 2 and the pattern of expression during PPA treatment was opposite to those of Y1R, GP, and CREB. Central knockdown (using antisense) or inhibition (using antagonist) of Y1R expression modulated the anorectic response of PPA and the reciprocal regulation between NPY and GP (or CREB), revealing an essential role of Y1R in regulating NPY, GP, and CREB. These results suggest that Y1R participates in the reciprocal regulation of NPY, GP, and CREB in the hypothalamus during PPA treatment in conscious rats. The present results may aid the therapeutic research of PPA and related antiobesity drugs.

23066089|t|Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiates heteromeric kainate receptors.
23066089|a|Kainate receptors (KARs), a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are widely expressed in the central nervous system and are critically involved in synaptic transmission. KAR activation is influenced by metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu) signaling, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We undertook studies to examine how mGlu modulation affects activation of KARs. Confocal immunohistochemistry of rat hippocampus and cultured rat cortex revealed colocalization of the high-affinity KAR subunits with group I mGlu receptors. In hippocampal and cortical cultures, the calcium signal caused by activation of native KARs was potentiated by activation of group I mGlu receptors. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, activation of group I mGlu receptors potentiated heteromeric but not homomeric KAR-mediated currents, with no change in agonist potency. The potentiation of heteromeric KARs by mGlu1 activation was attenuated by GDPβS, blocked by an inhibitor of phospholipase C or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), prolonged by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, but unaffected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition reduced the potentiation by mGlu1 of GluK2/GluK5, and conversely, direct activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate potentiated GluK2/GluK5. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified three serines (Ser833, Ser836, and Ser840) within the membrane proximal region of the GluK5 C-terminal domain that, in combination, are required for mGlu1-mediated potentiation of KARs. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of key residues in the C-terminal domain changes the overall charge of this domain, resulting in potentiated agonist responses.

23073075|t|Fingolimod protects cultured cortical neurons against excitotoxic death.
23073075|a|Fingolimod (FTY720), a novel drug approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, activates different sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) subtypes. Its primary mechanism of action is to reduce the egress of T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs, thus restraining neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. However, recent evidence suggests that the action of FTY720 involves S1PRs expressed by cells resident in the CNS, including neurons. Here, we examined the effect of FTY720, its active metabolite, FTY720-P, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on neuronal viability using a classical in vitro model of excitotoxic neuronal death. Mixed cultures of mouse cortical cells were challenged with toxic concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) for 10 min, and neuronal death was assessed 20 h later. FTY720, FTY720-P, and S1P were all neuroprotective when applied 18-20 h prior to the NMDA pulse. Neuroprotection was attenuated by pertussis toxin, and inhibited by the selective type-1 S1PR (S1P1R) antagonist, W146, and by inhibitors of the mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns-3-K) pathways. Both FTY720 and FTY720-P retained their protective activity in pure cultures of mouse or rat cortical neurons. These data offer the first direct demonstration that FTY720 and its active metabolite protect neurons against excitotoxic death.

23075005|t|Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of [(14)C]anagliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, in humans.
23075005|a|1. The disposition of anagliptin, an orally active, highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, was investigated after a single oral dose of 100 mg/1.92 MBq [(14)C]anagliptin to six healthy men. Almost all the dose (98.2%) was recovered within 168 h: 73.2% in urine and 25.0% in faeces. 2. Anagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations of unchanged drug attained at a mean time of 1.8-h postdose. Mean fraction of the dose absorbed was >73%. Unchanged drug and a carboxylate metabolite (M1) were the major components in plasma, accounting for 66.0 and 23.4% of total plasma radioactivity area under the curve, respectively. 3. Anagliptin was incompletely metabolized, with about 50% dose eliminated as unchanged drug (46.6% in urine and 4.1% in faeces). Metabolism to M1 accounted for 29.2% of the dose. No other metabolite accounted for >1% dose in excreta or yielded measurable systemic exposure. Terminal half-life of anagliptin and M1 was 4.37 and 9.88 h, respectively. Renal clearance of unbound anagliptin and unbound M1 far exceeded glomerular filtration rate, indicating active renal elimination: that might reflect the fact that anagliptin may be a substrate of OAT1, OAT3, MDR1 and MRP2, and M1 a substrate of OAT3, BCRP, MRP2 and MRP4.

23085436|t|Chemical cholecystokinin receptor activation protects against obesity-diabetes in high fat fed mice and has sustainable beneficial effects in genetic ob/ob mice.
23085436|a|The current study has determined the ability of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 to counter the development of diet-induced obesity-diabetes and examined persistence of beneficial metabolic effects in high fat and ob/ob mice, respectively. Twice daily injection of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 in normal mice transferred to a high fat diet reduced energy intake (p < 0.001), body weight (p < 0.01), circulating insulin and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and improved insulin sensitivity (p < 0.001) as well as oral and intraperitoneal (p < 0.001) glucose tolerance. Energy intake, body weight, circulating insulin and glucose tolerance of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 mice were similar to lean controls. In addition, (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 prevented the effect of high fat feeding on triacylglycerol accumulation in liver and muscle. Interestingly, (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 significantly (p < 0.001) elevated pancreatic glucagon content. Histological examination of the pancreata of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 mice revealed no changes in islet number or size, but there was increased turnover of beta-cells with significantly (p < 0.001) increased numbers of peripherally located alpha-cells, co-expressing both glucagon and GLP-1. Beneficial metabolic effects were observed similarly in ob/ob mice treated twice daily with (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 for 18 days, including significantly reduced energy intake (p < 0.05), body weight (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01), circulating glucose (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01) and insulin (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) and improved glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (p < 0.001). Notably, these beneficial effects were still evident 18 days following cessation of treatment. These studies emphasize the potential of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 for the treatment of obesity-diabetes.

23091188|t|Combination lopinavir and ritonavir alter exogenous and endogenous bile acid disposition in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.
23091188|a|Inhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) can cause intracellular accumulation of bile acids and is a risk factor for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Antiretroviral protease inhibitors lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) are reported BSEP inhibitors. However, the consequences of LPV and RTV, alone and combined (LPV/r), on hepatocyte viability, bile acid transport, and endogenous bile acid disposition in rat hepatocytes have not been examined. The effect of LPV, RTV, and LPV/r on cellular viability and the disposition of [(3)H]taurocholic acid (TCA) and [(14)C]chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was determined in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) and suspended rat hepatocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase and ATP assays revealed a concentration-dependent effect of LPV and RTV on cellular viability. LPV (5 µM), alone and combined with 5 µM RTV, significantly decreased [(3)H]TCA accumulation in cells + bile of SCRHs compared with control. LPV/r significantly increased [(3)H]TCA cellular accumulation (7.7 ± 0.1 pmol/mg of protein) compared with vehicle and 5 µM LPV alone (5.1 ± 0.7 and 5.0 ± 0.5 pmol/mg of protein). The [(3)H]TCA biliary clearance was reduced significantly by LPV and RTV and further reduced by LPV/r. LPV and RTV did not affect the initial uptake rates of [(3)H]TCA or [(14)C]CDCA in suspended rat hepatocytes. LPV (50 µM), RTV (5 µM), and LPV/r (5 and 50 µM/5 µM) significantly decreased the accumulation of total measured endogenous bile acids (TCA, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and α/β-tauromuricholic acid) in SCRH. Quantification of endogenous bile acids in SCRH may reveal important adaptive responses associated with exposure to known BSEP inhibitors.

23099431|t|Pharmacokinetic study of Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptide 6 (GHRP-6) in nine male healthy volunteers.
23099431|a|GHRP-6 is a growth hormone secretagogue that also enhances tissue viability in different organs. In the present work, we studied the pharmacokinetics of this short therapeutic hexapeptide (His-(D-Trp)-Ala-Trp-(D-Phe)-Lys-NH(2,) MW=872.44 Da) in nine male healthy volunteers after a single intravenous bolus administration of 100, 200 and 400 μg/kg of body weight. GHRP-6 was quantified in human plasma by a specific LC-MS method, previously developed and validated following FDA guidelines, using (13)C(3)Ala-GHRP-6 as internal standard (Gil et al., 2012, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 60, 19-25). The Lower Limit of Quantification (5 ng/mL) was reached in all subjects at 12h post-administration, which was sufficient for modeling a pharmacokinetic profile including over 85% of the Area under the Curve (AUC). Disposition of GHRP-6 best fitted a bi-exponential function with R(2) higher than 0.99, according to a mathematic modeling and confirmed by an Akaike index (AIC) lower than that of the corresponding one-compartment model for all subjects. Averaging all three dose levels, the distribution and elimination half-life of GHRP-6 were 7.6 ± 1.9 min and 2.5 ± 1.1h, respectively. These values are coherent with existing data for other drugs whose disposition also fits this model. Dose dependence analysis revealed a noticeable trend for AUC to increase proportionally with administered dose. Atypical GHRP-6 concentration spikes were observed during the elimination phase in four out of the nine subjects studied.

23102509|t|Efficacy of asiatic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene on attenuating the key enzymes activities of carbohydrate metabolism in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
23102509|a|Asiatic acid (AA), a triterpenoid derivative of Centella asiatica, has shown significant biological effects of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antihyperglycemic effect of AA on the activities of hepatic enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. To induce diabetes mellitus, rats were injected with streptozotocin intraperitoneally at a single dose of 40 mg/kg b.w. Diabetic rats showed significant (p<0.05) increased in plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and significant (p<0.05) decreased in circulating insulin and hemoglobin. The altered activities of key enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of carbohydrate metabolism significantly (p<0.05) increased whereas hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycogen content significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the liver of diabetic rats and also increased activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Oral administration of AA (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w.) and glibenclamide (600 μg/kg b.w.) to diabetic rats for 45 days prevented the above alteration and reverted to near normalcy. Protection of body weight loss of diabetic rats by AA was also observed. No significant effect was observed in normal rats treated with AA (20 mg/kg b.w.). In this search, AA found to be potential bioactive compound to regulate the carbohydrate metabolism by modulating the key regulatory enzymes in diabetic rats. These findings merit further research in this field.

23103563|t|Ibandronate increases the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS by epigenetic mechanisms in tumor cells.
23103563|a|There is growing evidence that aminobisphosphonates like ibandronate show anticancer activity by an unknown mechanism. Biochemically, they prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small GTPases, thus inhibiting their activity. In tumor cells, activated RAS-GTPase, the founding member of the gene family, down-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS via epigenetic DNA-methylation by DNMT1. We compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human U-2 osteosarcoma and in mouse CCL-51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized non-neoplastic MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Ibandronate attenuated cell proliferation in all cell lines tested. In the neoplastic cells we found up-regulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. Further we found stimulation of FAS-expression as a result of epigenetic DNA demethylation that was due to down-regulation of DNMT1, which was rescued by re-isoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesylpyrophosphate. In contrast, ibandronate did not affect FAS and DNMT1 expression in MC3T3-E1 non-neoplastic cells. Data suggest that bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small-GTPases induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells by DNA-CpG-demethylation and stimulation of FAS-expression. In conclusion the shown epigenetic mechanism underlying the anti-neoplastic activity of farnesyl-transferase-inhibition, also explains the clinical success of other drugs, which target this pathway.

23117151|t|Androgen receptor CAG repeat length modifies the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on receptor activity in human prostate cells.
23117151|a|Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5α-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.

23122072|t|An improved mass spectrometric method for identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in apple fruits.
23122072|a|Thirty-nine phenolic compounds were analysed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with diode array and accurate mass spectrometry detection using electrospray ionisation (DAD/ESI-am-MS). Instrumental parameters such as scan speed, resolution, and mass accuracy were optimised to establish accurate mass measurements. The method was fully validated in terms of model deviation (r(2)>0.9990), range (typically 10-3500 ngg(-1)), intra/inter-day precision (<6% and <8%, respectively) and accuracy (typically 100 ± 10%). The mass accuracy of each selected phenolic compound was below 1.5 ppm. The results confirmed that the UHPLC-DAD/ESI-am-MS method developed here was convenient and reliable for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple extracts.

23123257|t|Reduced in vitro and in vivo toxicity of siRNA-lipoplexes with addition of polyglutamate.
23123257|a|We previously designed a new siRNA vector that efficiently silences genes in vitro and in vivo. The vector originality is based on the fact that, in addition to the siRNA molecule, it contains two components: 1) a cationic liposome that auto-associates with the siRNA to form particles called "lipoplexes" and, 2) an anionic polymer which enhances the lipoplex's efficiency. This anionic polymer can be a nucleic acid, a polypeptide or a polysaccharide. We show here how the nature of the added anionic polymer into our siRNA delivery system impacts the toxic effects induced by siRNA lipoplexes. We first observed that: (i) siRNA lipoplexes-induced toxicity was cell line dependent, tumoral cell lines being the more sensitive; and (ii) plasmid DNA-containing siRNA lipoplexes were more toxic than polyglutamate-containing ones or cationic liposomes. We next determined that the toxicity induced by plasmid-containing lipoplexes is a long-lasting effect that decreased cell survival capacity for several generations. We also found that treated cells underwent death following apoptosis pathway. Systemic injection to mice of siRNA lipoplexes, rather than of cationic liposome, triggered a production of several cytokines in mice and replacement of plasmid by polyglutamate reduced the elevation of all assayed cytokines. In order to enhance siRNA lipoplexes efficiency, the addition of polyglutamate as anionic polymer should be preferred to plasmid DNA as far as in vitro as well as in vivo toxicity is concerned.

23123298|t|Helenalin-induced apoptosis is dependent on production of reactive oxygen species and independent of induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in renal cell carcinoma.
23123298|a|Helenalin, a sesquiterpene lactone, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. Here, we investigated whether helenalin could induce apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Helenalin increased apoptosis in dose dependent manner in Caki cells, and also induced apoptosis in other carcinoma cells, such as human renal carcinoma ACHN cells, human colon carcinoma HT29 and HCT116 cells. We found that helenalin markedly induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, such as regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD) 1, activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and/or the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). However, down-regulation of ATF4 and/or CHOP expression by siRNA had no effect on helenalin-induced apoptosis in Caki and HCT116 cells. Helenalin increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, ROS scavengers, N-acetylcystine (NAC), and glutathione ethyl ester (GEE), reduced helenalin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, helenalin induced apoptosis via ROS generation in human renal carcinoma Caki cells.

23123662|t|Contributions of rat Ctr1 to the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum anticancer drugs in dorsal root ganglion neurons.
23123662|a|Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are affected by platinum-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative processes associated with disturbed copper homeostasis and transport. This study aimed to understand the role of copper transporter 1 (Ctr1) in the uptake and toxicity of copper and platinum drugs in cultured rat DRG neurons, and the functional activities of rat Ctr1 (rCtr1) as a membrane transporter of copper and platinum drugs. Heterologous expression of rCtr1 in HEK293 cells (HEK/rCtr1 cells) increased the uptake and cytotoxicity of copper, oxaliplatin, cisplatin and carboplatin, in comparison to isogenic vector-transfected control cells. Cultured rat DRG neurons endogenously expressed rCtr1 protein on their neuronal cell body plasma membranes and cytoplasm, and displayed substantial capacity for taking up copper, but were resistant to copper toxicity. The uptake of copper by both cultured rat DRG neurons and HEK/rCtr1 cells was saturable and inhibited by cold temperature, silver and zinc, consistent with it being mediated by rCtr1. Cultured rat DRG neurons accumulated platinum during their exposure to oxaliplatin and were sensitive to oxaliplatin cytotoxicity. The accumulation of platinum by both cultured rat DRG neurons and HEK/rCtr1 cells, during oxaliplatin exposure, was saturable and temperature dependent, but was inhibited by copper only in HEK/rCtr1 cells. In conclusion, rCtr1 can transport copper and platinum drugs, and sensitizes cells to their cytotoxicities. DRG neurons display substantial capacity for accumulating copper via a transport process mediated by rCtr1, but appear able to resist copper toxicity and use alternative mechanisms to take up oxaliplatin.

23128353|t|Cell cycle regulation by glucosamine in human pulmonary epithelial cells.
23128353|a|Airway epithelial cells play an important role against intruding pathogens. Glucosamine, a commonly used supplemental compound, has recently begun to be regarded as a potential anti-inflammatory molecule. This study aimed to uncover how glucosamine impacts on cellular proliferation in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). With trypan blue-exclusion assay, we observed that glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mM) caused a decrease in cell number at 24 and 48 h; with a flow cytometric analysis, we also noted an enhanced cell accumulation within the G(0)/G(1) phase at 24 h and induction of late apoptosis at 24 and 48 h by glucosamine (10, 20, 50 mM) in A549 cells and HBECs. Examination of phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, we found an inhibitory effect by glucosamine at 20 and 50 mM. Glucosamine at 50 mM was demonstrated to elevate both the mRNA and protein expression of p53 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), but also caused a reduction in p21 protein expression. In addition, glucosamine attenuated p21 protein stability via the proteasomal proteolytic pathway, as well as inducing p21 nuclear accumulation. Altogether, our results suggest that a high dose of glucosamine may inhibit cell proliferation through apoptosis and disturb cell cycle progression with a halt at G(0)/G(1) phase, and that this occurs, at least in part, by a reduction in Rb phosphorylation together with modulation of p21, p53 and HO-1 expression, and nuclear p21 accumulation.

23131177|t|Characterization of substituted phenylpropylamides as highly selective agonists at the melatonin MT2 receptor.
23131177|a|Melatonin is a widely distributed hormone that regulates several major physiological processes, including the circadian rhythm and seasonal adaptation. The two subtypes of mammalian G protein-coupled melatonin receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the actions of melatonin. Because synthetic melatonin agonists have considerable therapeutic potentials in modulating insomnia and circadian- related sleep disorders, it is highly desirable to develop subtype-selective melatoninergic compounds. The pharmacological potencies of a series of substituted N-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propyl] amides towards human melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors were evaluated by the FLIPR high-throughput screening assay, whilst their subtype-selectivity was subsequently verified with ERK phosphorylation and cAMP assays. Structure-activity relationship analysis of highly potent subtype-selective ligands (MT(2) EC(50) 10-90 pM) revealed that a benzyloxyl substituent incorporated at C6 position of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring dramatically enhanced the MT(2) potency and at the same time decreased MT(1) potency. Incorporation of structural moieties conferring the subtype selectivity produced several extremely potent MT(2)-selective ligands. The most potent subtype-selective ligand, 2q had a substantially higher potency for MT(2) receptor than melatonin for elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and inhibition of forskolin-elevated cAMP. Representative MT(2)-selective ligands also induced ERK phosphorylation in both recombinant and native cell lines, and no cross-reactivity to 17 other GPCRs could be detected. These ligands represent invaluable tools for delineating the functional roles of distinct melatonin receptor subtypes and are viable candidates for drug development.

23142699|t|Proto-oncogene PIM-1 is a novel estrogen receptor target associating with high grade breast tumors.
23142699|a|We searched ERα cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ERα targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ERα-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ERα target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.

23143891|t|Metabolic pathways of inhaled glucocorticoids by the CYP3A enzymes.
23143891|a|Asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, for which the mainstay treatment has been inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs). Despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled GCs. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. The objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of GCs by the CYP3A family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP3A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. CYP3A4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and CYP3A7 had the slowest rates. CYP3A5, which is particularly relevant to GC metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. In contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via CYP3A4, with no significant turnover by CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Common metabolites included 6β-hydroxylation and Δ(6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. The structure of Δ(6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by NMR analysis.

23159329|t|Distinct roles of methamphetamine in modulating spatial memory consolidation, retrieval, reconsolidation and the accompanying changes of ERK and CREB activation in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
23159329|a|Drugs of abuse modulated learning and memory in humans yet the underlying mechanism remained unclear. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were involved in neuroplastic changes associated with learning and memory. In the current study, we used a Morris water maze to examine the effect of methamphetamine (METH) on different processes of spatial memory in mice. We then investigated the status of ERK and CREB in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that 1.0 mg/kg dose of METH facilitated spatial memory consolidation when it was injected immediately after the last learning trial. In contrast, the same dose of METH had no effect on spatial memory retrieval when it was injected 30 min before the test. Furthermore, 1.0 mg/kg dose of METH injected immediately after retrieval had no effect on spatial memory reconsolidation. Activation of both ERK and CREB in the hippocampus was found following memory consolidation but not after retrieval or reconsolidation in METH-treated mouse groups. In contrast, activation of both ERK and CREB in the PFC was found following memory retrieval but not other processes in METH-treated mouse groups. These results suggested that METH facilitated spatial memory consolidation but not retrieval or reconsolidation. Moreover, activation of the ERK and CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus might be involved in METH-induced spatial memory changes.

23159479|t|The impact of oxytocin administration and maternal love withdrawal on event-related potential (ERP) responses to emotional faces with performance feedback.
23159479|a|This is the first experimental study on the effect of oxytocin administration on the neural processing of facial stimuli conducted with female participants that uses event-related potentials (ERPs). Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design, we studied the effects of 16 IU of intranasal oxytocin on ERPs to pictures combining performance feedback with emotional facial expressions in 48 female undergraduate students. Participants also reported on the amount of love withdrawal they experienced from their mothers. Vertex positive potential (VPP) and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes were more positive after oxytocin compared to placebo administration. This suggests that oxytocin increased attention to the feedback stimuli (LPP) and enhanced the processing of emotional faces (VPP). Oxytocin heightened processing of the happy and disgusted faces primarily for those reporting less love withdrawal. Significant associations with LPP amplitude suggest that more maternal love withdrawal relates to the allocation of attention toward the motivationally relevant combination of negative feedback with a disgusted face.

23161868|t|Ras-dva is a novel Pit-1- and glucocorticoid-regulated gene in the embryonic anterior pituitary gland.
23161868|a|Glucocorticoids play a role in functional differentiation of pituitary somatotrophs and lactotrophs during embryogenesis. Ras-dva was identified as a gene regulated by anterior neural fold protein-1/homeobox expressed in embryonic stem cells-1, a transcription factor known to be critical in pituitary development, and has an expression profile in the chicken embryonic pituitary gland that is consistent with in vivo regulation by glucocorticoids. The objective of this study was to characterize expression and regulation of ras-dva mRNA in the developing chicken anterior pituitary. Pituitary ras-dva mRNA levels increased during embryogenesis to a maximum on embryonic day (e) 18 and then decreased and remained low or undetectable after hatch. Ras-dva expression was highly enriched in the pituitary gland on e18 relative to other tissues examined. Glucocorticoid treatment of pituitary cells from mid- and late-stage embryos rapidly increased ras-dva mRNA, suggesting it may be a direct transcriptional target of glucocorticoids. A reporter construct driven by 4 kb of the chicken ras-dva 5'-flanking region, containing six putative pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) binding sites and two potential glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites, was highly activated in embryonic pituitary cells and up-regulated by corticosterone. Mutagenesis of the most proximal Pit-1 site decreased promoter activity in chicken e11 pituitary cells, indicating regulation of ras-dva by Pit-1. However, mutating putative GR binding sites did not substantially reduce induction of ras-dva promoter activity by corticosterone, suggesting additional DNA elements within the 5'-flanking region are responsible for glucocorticoid regulation. We have identified ras-dva as a glucocorticoid-regulated gene that is likely expressed in cells of the Pit-1 lineage within the developing anterior pituitary gland.

23164615|t|Differential modulation of retinal ganglion cell light responses by orthosteric and allosteric metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 compounds.
23164615|a|To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells, we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8, AZ12216052 (AZ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG). These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.

23178182|t|UCCB01-125, a dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, reduces inflammatory pain without disrupting cognitive or motor performance: comparison with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801.
23178182|a|Excessive N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent production of nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic pain states, and is mediated by postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). By binding to both the NMDAR and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), PSD-95 mediates a specific coupling between NMDAR activation and NO production. NMDAR antagonism shows anti-nociceptive action in humans and animal models of chronic pain but is associated with severe disturbances of cognitive and motor functions. An alternative approach to modulate the NMDAR-related activity is to perturb the NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS complex by targeting PSD-95, thereby decreasing NO production without interfering with the NMDAR ion channel function. Here, we compared the effects of a dimeric PSD-95 inhibitor, UCCB01-125, and the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, on mechanical hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain. To examine side-effect profiles we also compared the effects of UCCB01-125 and MK-801 in tests of attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. When administered concurrently with CFA, both MK-801 and UCCB01-125 prevented the development of CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 1 and 24 h after treatment. Moreover, UCCB01-125 was found to reverse CFA-induced hypersensitivity when administered 24 h after CFA treatment, an effect lasting for at least 3 days. At the dose reducing hypersensitivity, MK-801 disrupted attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. By contrast, even high doses of UCCB01-125 were devoid of side-effects in these tests. The data suggest that PSD-95 inhibition is a feasible strategy to prevent both development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain, while avoiding NMDAR antagonism-related side-effects.

23181488|t|Conformational landscape of diisopropyl ketone: quantum chemical calculations validated by microwave spectroscopy.
23181488|a|We report on the gas-phase structure of the most abundant conformer of diisopropyl ketone, (CH(3))(2)HC-CO-CH(CH(3))(2), as observed by molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The gas-phase structures of five conformers of diisopropyl ketone were optimized using ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The natures of the stationary points were verified using harmonic frequency calculations. The only conformer observed in the supersonic jet possesses C(2) symmetry and appears as an enantiomeric pair. From the microwave spectrum, a set of three highly accurate rotational constants, five centrifugal distortion constants, and three sextic centrifugal distortion constants were determined. The structure of the observed conformer was optimized again at different levels of theory using the HF, MP2, and B3LYP methods. The theoretical constants of the C(2) conformer were subsequently validated using the experimental constants. To understand the transitions of one conformer to the others, the isopropyl groups were rotated against each other. The resulting two-dimensional potential energy surface shows nicely the symmetry of the conformational landscape and also indicates the enantiomeric pairs of the conformers. The barriers to internal rotation of the methyl groups were determined to be 1052 and 905 cm(-1) at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) and the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels, respectively. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, no internal rotation patterns could be observed in the microwave spectrum.

23182766|t|Control of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis using the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid sequence of the translocator protein TSPO.
23182766|a|The translocator protein (18-kDa) TSPO is an ubiquitous high affinity cholesterol-binding protein reported to be present in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels; its expression dramatically increased in macrophages found in atherosclerotic plaques. A domain in the carboxy-terminus of TSPO was identified and characterized as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC). The ability of the CRAC domain to bind to cholesterol led us to hypothesize that this peptide could be used as an hypocholesterolemic, with potential anti-atherogenic properties, agent. We report herein the therapeutic benefit that resulted for the administration of the VLNYYVWR human CRAC sequence to guinea pigs fed with a high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice. CRAC treatment (3 and 30mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks) resulted in reduced circulating cholesterol levels in guinea pigs fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice. In high cholesterol fed guinea pigs, CRAC treatment administered once daily induced an increase in circulating HDL, decreased total, free and LDL cholesterol, and removed atheroma deposits in the aorta in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment also prevented the high cholesterol diet-induced increase in serum creatine kinase, total and isoforms, markers of neurological, cardiac and muscular damage. No toxicity was observed. Taken together these results support a role of TSPO in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis and indicate that CRAC may constitute a novel and safe treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

23187687|t|Effects of bidentate coordination on the molecular properties rapta-C based complex using theoretical approach.
23187687|a|In this work several quantum properties including the NEDA and QTAIM are computed on three models of rapta-C complexes using DFT with hybrid functional and basis set with ECP and without ECP. Several interesting correlations within the observed properties and also with the reported experimental behaviors of these complexes including their biological activities are presented. The study shows that the stability of the two complexes with bidentate ligands is associated with their high hydrogen bonding stability and existence of stronger non-covalent metal-ligand bonds. The energy decomposition analysis indicated that inter-atomic interactions in the three forms of rapta-C complexes and their stability are governed by the charge transfer term with significant contributions from polarization and electrostatic terms. The higher stability of complex 1 and 2 over 3 comes from the lower exchange repulsion and higher polarization contributions to their stability which agrees perfectly with the experimental observation. Our results provide insight into the nature of intramolecular forces that influence the structural stability of the three complexes.

23192339|t|Transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) increases gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) expression in enteroendocrine K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in high fat diet-induced obesity.
23192339|a|Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin released from enteroendocrine K-cells in response to nutrient ingestion. GIP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces energy accumulation into adipose tissue, resulting in obesity. Plasma GIP levels are reported to be increased in the obese state. However, the molecular mechanisms of GIP secretion and high fat diet (HFD)-induced GIP hypersecretion remain unclear, primarily due to difficulties in separating K-cells from other intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. In this study, GIP-GFP knock-in mice that enable us to visualize K-cells by enhanced GFP were established. Microarray analysis of isolated K-cells from these mice revealed that transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) is expressed exclusively in K-cells. In vitro experiments using the mouse intestinal cell line STC-1 showed that knockdown of Rfx6 decreased mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion of GIP. Rfx6 bound to the region in the gip promoter that regulates gip promoter activity, and overexpression of Rfx6 increased GIP mRNA expression. HFD induced obesity and GIP hypersecretion in GIP-GFP heterozygous mice in vivo. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis showed no significant difference in K-cell number between control fat diet-fed (CFD) and HFD-fed mice. However, GIP content in the upper small intestine and GIP mRNA expression in K-cells were significantly increased in HFD-fed mice compared with those in CFD-fed mice. Furthermore, expression levels of Rfx6 mRNA were increased in K-cells of HFD-fed mice. These results suggest that Rfx6 increases GIP expression and content in K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in HFD-induced obesity.

23194076|t|Diet, physical exercise and Orlistat administration increase serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
23194076|a|The present study investigates the combined effect of diet, physical exercise and Orlistat for 24 weeks, on serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in overweight and obese controls. Sixty-one (61) selected women with PCOS and 20 overweight and obese controls followed an energy-restricted diet, physical exercise plus Orlistat administration (120 mg, 3 times per day) for 24 weeks. At baseline, week 12 and week 24, serum levels of AMH, FSH, LH, PRL, androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, and insulin were measured and Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Insulin Resistance (IR) indices were calculated. In PCOS women, serum AMH levels increased after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks LH and SHBG were increased, while Testosterone decreased. After 12 and 24 weeks, FAI was decreased and all indices of IR were significantly improved. We concluded that in overweight and obese women with PCOS Orlistat administration, combined with diet and physical exercise, for 24 weeks, resulted in significant weight loss, improvement of hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitivity, and increased serum AMH levels.

23194511|t|Phenolic profiles and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp of different cultivars cultivated in Southern China.
23194511|a|The phenolic profiles and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp of 13 varieties were investigated. The free, bound and total phenolic contents were 66.17-226.03, 11.18-40.54, and 101.51-259.18 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g, respectively. The free, bound and total flavonoid contents were 16.68-110.33, 10.48-22.75, and 39.43-129.86 mg of catechin equivalents/100 g, respectively. Free phenolics and flavonoids contributed averagely 80.1% and 75% to their total contents, respectively. Six individual phenolics (gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, (+)-catechin, caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin, and rutin) were detected in litchi pulp by HPLC. The contents of each compound in free and bound fractions were determined. Significant varietal discrepancy in antioxidant activity was also found by FRAP and DPPH scavenging capacity methods. Antioxidant activity was significantly correlated with phenolic and flavonoid contents. Thus, phenolics and flavonoids exist mainly in the free form in litchi pulp. There were significant varietal differences in phytochemical contents and antioxidant activity of litchi pulp.

23198819|a|The development of clay bionanocomposites requires processing routes with nanostructural control. Moreover, moisture durability is a concern with water-soluble biopolymers. Here, oriented bionanocomposite coatings with strong in-plane orientation of clay platelets are for the first time prepared by continuous water-based processing. Montmorillonite (MTM) and a "new" unmodified biological polymer (xyloglucan (XG)) are combined. The resulting nanocomposites are characterized by FE-SEM, TEM, and XRD. XG adsorption on MTM is measured by quartz crystal microbalance analysis. Mechanical and gas barrier properties are measured, also at high relative humidity. The reinforcement effects are modeled. XG dimensions in composites are estimated using atomistic simulations. The nanostructure shows highly oriented and intercalated clay platelets. The reinforcement efficiency and effects on barrier properties are remarkable and are likely to be due to highly oriented and well-dispersed MTM and strong XG-MTM interactions. Properties are well preserved in humid conditions and the reasons for this are discussed.

23200732|t|Lessons from the dissection of the activation functions (AF-1 and AF-2) of the estrogen receptor alpha in vivo.
23200732|a|Estrogens influence most of the physiological processes in mammals, including but not limited to reproduction, cognition, behavior, vascular system, metabolism and bone integrity. Given this widespread role for estrogen in human physiology, it is not surprising that estrogen influence the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, including cancer (of the reproductive tract as breast, endometrial but also colorectal, prostate,…), as well as neurodegenerative, inflammatory-immune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and osteoporosis. These actions are mediated by the activation of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ), which regulate target gene transcription (genomic action) through two independent activation functions (AF)-1 and AF-2, but can also elicit rapid membrane initiated steroid signals (MISS). Targeted ER gene inactivation has shown that although ERβ plays an important role in the central nervous system and in the heart, ERα appears to play a prominent role in most of the other tissues. Pharmacological activation or inhibition of ERα and/or ERβ provides already the basis for many therapeutic interventions, from hormone replacement at menopause to prevention of the recurrence of breast cancer. However, the use of these estrogens or selective estrogen receptors modulators (SERMs) have also induced undesired effects. Thus, an important challenge consists now to uncouple the beneficial actions from other deleterious ones. The in vivo molecular "dissection" of ERα represents both a molecular and integrated approach that already allowed to delineate in mouse the role of the main "subfunctions" of the receptor and that could pave the way to an optimization of the ER modulation.

23201003|t|Inhibitory effect of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ on excretion of JBP485 via organic anion transporters in rats.
23201003|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic mechanism of interaction between JBP485 and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.64 nmol/kg/day 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in 1 ml/kg corn oil for 5 days. The plasma and urine concentrations of JBP485 after intravenous administration and the uptake of JBP485 in kidney slices in vitro were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemical analysis and immunofluorescence were used to determine the changes in the expression of organic anion transporter (Oat)1 and Oat3 in rat kidney in response to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. The plasma concentrations and AUCs of JBP485 were significantly increased, while the renal clearance of JBP485 and uptake of JBP485 in kidney slices were significantly decreased after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. These results confirmed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibited renal excretion of JBP485. Moreover, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) decreased expression of Oat1 and Oat3 in rat kidney. Our results are novel in demonstrating an interaction between JBP485 and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) when they are co-administered. The mechanism of interaction between JBP485 and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) could be explained at least in part by inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on expression of Oats in rat kidney.

23202250|t|Nanoparticle toxicity in Daphnia magna reproduction studies: the importance of test design.
23202250|a|The increasing use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) inevitably results in their release into the environment, raising concerns about potential adverse effects in wildlife. By following standard test protocols, several studies investigated the ecotoxicity of nTiO(2) among others to Daphnia magna. These studies indicated a large variability - several orders of magnitude - in the response variables. However, other factors, like nanoparticle characteristics and test design, potentially triggering these differences, were largely ignored. Therefore, the present study assessed the chronic ecotoxicity of two nTiO(2) products with varying crystalline structure (A-100; P25) to D. magna. A semi-static and a flow-through exposure scenario were compared, ensuring that both contained environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. Utilizing the semi-static test design, a concentration as low as 0.06 mg/L A-100 (∼330 nm) significantly reduced the reproduction of daphnia indicating environmental risk. In contrast, no implication in the number of released offspring was observed during the flow-through experiment with A-100 (∼140 nm). Likewise, P25 (∼130 nm) did not adversely affect reproduction irrespective of the test design utilized. Given the present study's results, the particle size, the product composition, i.e. the crystalline structure, and the accumulation of nTiO(2) at the bottom of the test vessel - the latter is relevant for a semi-static test design - may be suggested as factors potentially triggering differences in nTiO(2) toxicity to D. magna. Hence, these factors should be considered to improve environmental risk assessment of nanoparticles.

23205763|t|Magnetic nanoclusters exhibiting protein-activated near-infrared fluorescence.
23205763|a|Composite nanoclusters with chemical, magnetic, and biofunctionality offer broad opportunities for targeted cellular imaging. A key challenge is to load a high degree of targeting, imaging, and therapeutic functionality onto stable metal-oxide nanoparticles. Here we report a route for producing magnetic nanoclusters (MNCs) with alkyne surface functionality that can be utilized as multimodal imaging probes. We form MNCs composed of magnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles and poly(acrylic acid-co-propargyl acrylate) by the co-precipitation of iron salts in the presence of copolymer stabilizers. The MNCs were surface-modified with near-infrared (NIR) emitting fluorophore used in photodynamic therapy, an azide-modified indocyanine green. The fluorophores engaged and complexed with bovine serum albumin, forming an extended coverage of serum proteins on the MNCs. These proteins isolated indocyanine green fluorophores from the aqueous environment and induced an effective "turn-on" of NIR emission.

23210662|t|Dendronized albumin core-shell transporters with high drug loading capacity.
23210662|a|We describe the synthesis of a core-shell biohybrid consisting of a human serum albumin (HSA) core that serves as a reservoir for lipophilic molecules and a cationized shell region consisting of ethynyl-G2.0-PAMAM or ethynyl-G3.0-PAMAM dendrons. The binding capacity of lipophilic guests was quantified applying electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and five to six out of seven pockets were still available compared with HSA. The attachment of ethynyl-G2.0-PAMAM dendrons to HSA yielded a nontoxic core-shell macromolecule that was clearly uptaken by A549 human epithelial cells due to the presence of the dendritic PAMAM shell. Significantly higher loading of doxorubicin was observed for dendronized G2-DHSA compared with the native protein due to the availability of binding pockets of the HSA core, and interaction with the dendritic shell. Dendronized G2-DHSA-doxorubicin displayed significant cytotoxicity resulting from high drug loading and high stability under different conditions, thus demonstrating its great potential as a transporter for drug molecules.

23212306|t|Impairment of novel object recognition in adulthood after neonatal exposure to diazinon.
23212306|a|Diazinon is an organophosphate pesticide that is still heavily used in agriculture, home gardening, and indoor pest control in Japan. The present study investigated the effect of neonatal exposure to diazinon on hippocampus-dependent novel object recognition test performance and the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its signal transduction pathway-related genes in the hippocampi of young adult and adult mice. Male offspring of C3H/HeN mice were subcutaneously treated with 0, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg of diazinon for 4 consecutive days beginning on postnatal day (PND) 8. Beginning on PND 46 or PND 81, a novel object recognition test was performed on 4 consecutive days. The hippocampi were collected on PND 50 or PND 85 after the completion of the novel object recognition test, and the expression levels of neurotrophins and the NMDA receptor and its signal transduction pathway-related genes were examined using real-time RT-PCR. Diazinon-injected mice exhibited a poor ability to discriminate between novel and familiar objects during both the PND 49 and the PND 84 tests. The NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B and the related protein kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-IV and the transcription factor cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-1 mRNA levels were reduced in the PND 50 mice. However, no significant changes in the expressions of the NMDA subunits and their signal transduction molecules were observed in the hippocampi of the PND 85 mice. The expression level of nerve growth factor mRNA was significantly reduced in the PND 50 or 85 mice. These results indicate that neonatal diazinon exposure impaired the hippocampus-dependent novel object recognition ability, accompanied by a modulation in the expressions of the NMDA receptor and neurotrophin in young adult and adult mice.

23215039|t|Functional imaging of legumain in cancer using a new quenched activity-based probe.
23215039|a|Legumain is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose biological function remains poorly defined. Legumain activity is up-regulated in most human cancers and inflammatory diseases most likely as the result of high expression in populations of activated macrophages. Within the tumor microenvironment, legumain activity is thought to promote tumorigenesis. To obtain a greater understanding of the role of legumain activity during cancer progression and inflammation, we developed an activity-based probe that becomes fluorescent only upon binding active legumain. This probe is highly selective for legumain, even in the context of whole cells and tissues, and is also a more effective label of legumain than previously reported probes. Here we present the synthesis and application of our probe to the analysis of legumain activity in primary macrophages and in two mouse models of cancer. We find that legumain activity is highly correlated with macrophage activation and furthermore that it is an ideal marker for primary tumor inflammation and early stage metastatic lesions.

23218950|t|Mutational consequences of dNTP pool imbalances in E. coli.
23218950|a|The accuracy of DNA synthesis depends on the accuracy of the polymerase as well as the quality and concentration(s) of the available 5'-deoxynucleoside-triphosphate DNA precursors (dNTPs). The relationships between dNTPs and error rates have been studied in vitro, but only limited insights exist into these correlations during in vivo replication. We have investigated this issue in the bacterium Escherichia coli by analyzing the mutational properties of dcd and ndk strains. These strains, defective in dCTP deaminase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively, are characterized by both disturbances of dNTP pools and a mutator phenotype. ndk strains have been studied before, but were included in this study, as controversies exist regarding the source of its mutator phenotype. We show that dcd strains suffer from increased intracellular levels of dCTP (4-fold) and reduced levels of dGTP (2-fold), while displaying, as measured using a set of lacZ reversion markers in a mismatch-repair defective (mutL) background, a strong mutator effect for G·C→T·A and A·T→T·A transversions (27- and 42-fold enhancement, respectively). In contrast, ndk strains possess a lowered dATP level (4-fold) and modestly enhanced dCTP level (2-fold), while its mutator effect is specific for just the A·T→T·A transversions. The two strains also display differential mutability for rifampicin-resistant mutants. Overall, our analysis reveals for both strains a satisfactory correlation between dNTP pool alterations and the replication error rates, and also suggests that a minimal explanation for the ndk mutator does not require assumptions beyond the predicted effect of the dNTP pools.

23220614|t|MAPK signaling pathways regulate mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis induced by isoorientin in human hepatoblastoma cancer cells.
23220614|a|Isoorientin (ISO) (CAS RN: 4261-42-1) is a flavonoid compound that can be extracted from several plant species, such as Phyllostachys pubescens, Patrinia, and Drosophyllum lusitanicum. ISO is able to induce apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells, however, the effects of ISO on MAPK signaling pathways remain unknown. The present study investigated the effects of ISO on this pathway, and the roles of MAPK kinases on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The results showed that ISO induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induction apoptosis is main cause for ISO-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. ISO significantly inhibited the levels of ERK1/2 kinase and increased the expression of JNK and p38 kinases. Furthermore, U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced the ISO-induced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol fraction, and the levels of cleaved caspase-3. While SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) markedly prevented the expression of these proteins induced by ISO. Furthermore, the ROS inhibitor (NAC) notably promoted the inhibited effect of ISO on the ERK1/2 kinase. NAC also suppressed the p-JNK and p-p38, but failed to reverse the effects of ISO. These results demonstrated for the first time that ISO induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells through inactivating ERK1/2 kinase and activating JNK and p38 kinases, and ROS stimulated by ISO is able to activate the MAPK singaling pathway as the upstream signaling molecules. Initiating event of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis induced by ISO is MAPK signals.

23220618|t|Antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities of isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside and hyperoside.
23220618|a|The potential anticoagulant activities of two single compounds, isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside (IMG) and hyperoside, from Oenanthe javanica, were tested. The anticoagulant activities were investigated by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT), and the ability to inhibit production of thrombin and activated factor X (FXa) was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). And, the effects of the compounds on expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were tested in tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-α activated HUVECs. Treatment with IMG and hyperoside resulted in significantly prolonged aPTT and PT and inhibition of the activities of thrombin and FXa, and IMG or hyperoside inhibited production of thrombin and FXa in HUVECs. In accordance with these anticoagulant activities, both agents elicited anticoagulant effects in mouse. In addition, treatment with IMG and hyperoside resulted in inhibition of TNF-α-induced production of PAI-1, and treatment with IMG resulted in significant reduction of the PAI-1 to t-PA ratio. The anticoagulant and profibrinolytic effects of IMG were greater than those of hyperoside, indicating positive regulation of its anticoagulant function by the methoxy group of IMG. IMG and hyperoside possess antithrombotic activities and offer bases for development of a novel anticoagulant.

23220644|t|Optimization of 5-hydroxytryptamines as dual function inhibitors targeting phospholipase A2 and leukotriene A4 hydrolase.
23220644|a|Dual function inhibitors targeting phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) may balance the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network and be used as new anti-inflammatory drugs. In previous study, we discovered multi-target drugs towards the AA metabolic network, among which a dual-target inhibitor (JMC08-4) for human nonpancreatic secretory phospholipase A(2) (hnps-PLA(2)) and human leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H-h) was found. Based on the structure of compound JMC08-4, new dual-target inhibitors were designed assisted by molecular docking. In this report, a series of 5-hydroxytryptamine compounds were synthesized; and most of these title compounds showed more potent inhibitory activity than compound JMC08-4 in the in vitro bioassay against these two enzymes. The best one inhibited hnps-PLA(2) and LTA(4)H-h with IC(50) values of 9.2 ± 0.5 μM and 2.4 ± 1.4 μM, respectively.

23220749|t|Apomorphine is a bimodal modulator of TRPA1 channels.
23220749|a|Apomorphine is a non-narcotic derivative of morphine, which acts as a dopamine agonist and is clinically used to treat "off-states" in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects of apomorphine treatment include severe emesis and nausea, and ulceration and pain at the injection site. We wanted to test whether sensory transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a molecular target for apomorphine. Here, we show that rTRPV1, rTRPV2, rTRPV3, and mTRPV4, as well as hTRPM8, and rTRPM3, which are expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, are insensitive toward apomorphine treatment. This also applied to the cellular redox sensor hTRPM2. On the contrary, human TRPA1 could be concentration-dependently modulated by apomorphine. Whereas the addition of apomorphine in the low micromolar range produced an irreversible activation of the channel, application of higher concentrations caused a reversible voltage-dependent inhibition of heterologously expressed TRPA1 channels, resulting from a reduction of single-channel open times. In addition, we provide evidence that apomorphine also acts on endogenous TRPA1 in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from rats and in the enterochromaffin model cell line QGP-1, from which serotonin is released upon activation of TRPA1. Our study shows that human TRPA1 is a target for apomorphine, suggesting that an activation of TRPA1 might contribute to adverse side effects such as nausea and painful injections, which can occur during treatment with apomorphine.

23221600|t|Human stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) gene expression is negatively regulated by thyroid hormone without direct binding of thyroid hormone receptor to the gene promoter.
23221600|a|Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) plays a pivotal role in an increase of triglyceride by an excess of dietary carbohydrate intake. Dietary carbohydrates increase SCD-1 gene expression in liver by sterol response element binding protein (SREBP)-1c-dependent and SREBP-1c -independent pathways. Previous report demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH) negatively regulates mouse SCD-1 gene promoter before SREBP-1c was revealed. We reported that TH negatively regulates SREBP-1c recently. Therefore, in the current study, we examined whether and how TH regulates human SCD-1 gene expression and evaluated SREBP-1c effect on the negative regulation. Luciferase assays revealed that TH suppresses both mouse and human SCD-1 gene promoter activity. In SREBP-1 knockdown HepG2 cells, TH still suppresses SCD-1 gene promoter activity, and it also exerted the negative regulation under cotransfection of a small amount of SREBP-1c. These data indicated that SREBP-1c does not play the decisive role for the negative regulation by TH. The responsible region for the negative regulation in human SCD-1 gene promoter turned out to be between -124 and -92 bp, referred to as site A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TH receptor-β is recruited to the region upon T(3) administration, although TR-β does not bind directly to site A. In conclusion, TH negatively regulates human SCD-1 gene expression in without direct binding of the TH receptor to the SCD-1 gene promoter.

23223177|t|Dissociation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex by activated AMPK enhances cardiac autophagy and protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetes.
23223177|a|Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with suppression of cardiac autophagy, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) restores cardiac autophagy and prevents cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice, albeit by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity, inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling, and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely, activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.

23228696|t|Metformin-mediated downregulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent excision repair cross-complementing 1 decreases DNA repair capacity and sensitizes human lung cancer cells to paclitaxel.
23228696|a|Metformin, an extensively used and well-tolerated drug for treating individuals with type 2 diabetes, has recently gained significant attention as an anticancer drug. On the other hand, paclitaxel (Taxol) is a new antineoplastic drug that has shown promise in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression levels of excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) in cancers have been positively associated with the DNA repair capacity and a poor prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In this current study, paclitaxel was found to increase phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6)-p38 MAPK as well as protein and mRNA levels of ERCC1 in H1650 and H1703 cells. Moreover, paclitaxel-induced ERCC1 protein and mRNA levels significantly decreased via the downregulation of p38 activity by either a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 or p38 knockdown with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Specific inhibition of ERCC1 with siRNA was found to enhance the paclitaxel-induced cytotoxic effect and growth inhibition. Furthermore, metformin was able to not only decrease the paclitaxel-induced p38 MAPK-mediated ERCC1 expression, but also augment the cytotoxic effect induced by paclitaxel. Finally, expression of constitutive activate MKK6 or HA-p38 MAPK vectors in lung cancer cells was able to abrogate ERCC1 downregulation by metformin and paclitaxel as well as cell viability and DNA repair capacity. Overall, our results suggest that inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling by metformin coupled with paclitaxel therapy in human NSCLC cells may be a clinically useful combination, which however will require further validation.

23228697|t|Carboxylesterase-2 is a highly sensitive target of the antiobesity agent orlistat with profound implications in the activation of anticancer prodrugs.
23228697|a|Orlistat has been the most used anti-obesity drug and the mechanism of its action is to reduce lipid absorption by inhibiting gastrointestinal lipases. These enzymes, like carboxylesterases (CESs), structurally belong to the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily. Lipases and CESs are functionally related as well. Some CESs (e.g., human CES1) have been shown to hydrolyze lipids. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that orlistat inhibits CESs with higher potency toward CES1 than CES2, a carboxylesterase with little lipase activity. Liver microsomes and recombinant CESs were tested for the inhibition of the hydrolysis of standard substrates and the anticancer prodrugs pentyl carbamate of p-aminobenzyl carbamate of doxazolidine (PPD) and irinotecan. Contrary to the hypothesis, orlistat at 1 nM inhibited CES2 activity by 75% but no inhibition on CES1, placing CES2 one of the most sensitive targets of orlistat. The inhibition varied among some CES2 polymorphic variants. Pretreatment with orlistat reduced the cell killing activity of PPD. Certain mouse but not rat CESs were also highly sensitive. CES2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of many common drugs and abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal track and liver. Inhibition of this carboxylesterase probably presents a major source for altered therapeutic activity of these medicines if co-administered with orlistat. In addition, orlistat has been linked to various types of organ toxicities, and this study provides an alternative target potentially involved in these toxicological responses.

23229509|t|Regions on adenylyl cyclase VII required for selective regulation by the G13 pathway.
23229509|a|Regulation of multiple adenylyl cyclases (AC) provides unique inputs to mediate the synthesis of cAMP, a ubiquitous second messenger that controls many aspects of cellular function. On stimulation by G(s), the activities of ACs can be further selectively modulated by other pathways to ensure precise control of intracellular cAMP responses to specific stimuli. Recently, we reported that one of the AC isoforms, AC7, is uniquely regulated by the G(13) pathway. To understand more fully the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we compared the regulation of AC7 with that of AC2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages devoid of AC7. Although both enzymes could fully restore regulation of cAMP by Gβγ, activation of the G(13) pathway preferentially synergized with AC7. Exchange of domains between the two isoforms indicates that the C1b domain and the N-terminus of the C1a domain are important for directing selective regulation of AC7 by the G(13) pathway. A mutagenesis screen identified more specific regions of AC7 that differentially mediate its regulation by distinct pathways.

23229510|t|Identification and characterization of a potent activator of p53-independent cellular senescence via a small-molecule screen for modifiers of the integrated stress response.
23229510|a|The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a signaling program that enables cellular adaptation to stressful conditions like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. An important effector of the ISR is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid metabolism and transport. Because both inhibition and overactivation of the ISR can induce tumor cell death, modulators of ATF4 expression could prove to be clinically useful. In this study, chemical libraries were screened for modulators of ATF4 expression. We identified one compound, E235 (N-(1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-7-carboxamide), that activated the ISR and dose-dependently increased levels of ATF4 in transformed cells. A dose-dependent decrease in viability was observed in several mouse and human tumor cell lines, and knockdown of ATF4 significantly increased the antiproliferative effects of E235. Interestingly, low μM doses of E235 induced senescence in many cell types, including HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. E235-mediated induction of senescence was not dependent on p21 or p53; however, p21 conferred protection against the growth inhibitory effects of E235. Treatment with E235 resulted in an increase in cells arrested at the G2/M phase with a concurrent decrease in S-phase cells. E235 also activated DNA damage response signaling, resulting in increased levels of Ser15-phosphorylated p53, γ-H2AX, and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), although E235 does not appear to cause physical DNA damage. Induction of γ-H2AX was abrogated in ATF4 knockdown cells. Together, these results suggest that modulation of the ISR pathway with the small molecule E235 could be a promising antitumor strategy.

23231492|t|Tilting the balance between canonical and noncanonical conformations for the H1 hypervariable loop of a llama VHH through point mutations.
23231492|a|Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies found in camelids. These are the smallest naturally occurring binding domains and derive functionality via three hypervariable loops (H1-H3) that form the binding surface. They are excellent candidates for antibody engineering because of their favorable characteristics like small size, high solubility, and stability. To rationally engineer antibodies with affinity for a specific target, the hypervariable loops can be tailored to obtain the desired binding surface. As a first step toward such a goal, we consider the design of loops with a desired conformation. In this study, we focus on the H1 loop of the anti-hCG llama nanobody that exhibits a noncanonical conformation. We aim to "tilt" the stability of the H1 loop structure from a noncanonical conformation to a (humanized) type 1 canonical conformation by studying the effect of selected mutations to the amino acid sequence of the H1, H2, and proximal residues. We use all-atomistic, explicit-solvent, biased molecular dynamic simulations to simulate the wild-type and mutant loops in a prefolded framework. We thus find mutants with increasing propensity to form a stable type 1 canonical conformation of the H1 loop. Free energy landscapes reveal the existence of conformational isomers of the canonical conformation that may play a role in binding different antigenic surfaces. We also elucidate the approximate mechanism and kinetics of transitions between such conformational isomers by using a Markovian model. We find that a particular three-point mutant has the strongest thermodynamic propensity to form the H1 type 1 canonical structure but also to exhibit transitions between conformational isomers, while a different, more rigid three-point mutant has the strongest propensity to be kinetically trapped in such a canonical structure.

23233034|t|Synthesis and NIR optical properties of hollow gold nanospheres with LSPR greater than one micrometer.
23233034|a|Optical analysis in the near infrared region is of significant biological importance due to better tissue penetration and reduced autofluorescence. In this work, an improved synthesis of hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs), which provides a tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from 610 nm up to 1320 nm, is demonstrated. The scattering properties of these nanoparticles are shown using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) at 1064 nm excitation wavelength and are compared to citrate reduced gold and silver nanoparticles of similar physical sizes and surface properties. After the addition of salts, a strong signal was observed from hollow gold with a LSPR of 650 nm and a weaker, yet observable, signal from HGNs with a LSPR of 775 nm. However, no obvious signals were observed in the case of standard citrate reduced gold, silver or HGNs with a LSPR of 1080 nm. The absorption properties of HGNs were investigated by monitoring their photothermal activity. In this case, different nanoparticle suspensions including citrate reduced gold, silver, and HGNs were illuminated by a continuous laser at 785 nm excitation wavelength and the absorption efficiency of HGNs with a LSPR of 775 nm was calculated to be 0.81% which is more than 5 times higher than the absorption efficiency of citrate reduced gold nanoparticles under similar conditions.

23234313|t|Influence of surface groups on poly(propylene imine) dendrimers antiprion activity.
23234313|a|Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of PrP(Sc), an aberrantly folded isoform of the host protein PrP(C). Specific forms of synthetic molecules known as dendrimers are able to eliminate protease-resistant PrP(Sc) in both an intracellular and in vitro setting. The properties of a dendrimer which govern this ability are unknown. We addressed the issue by comparing the in vitro antiprion ability of numerous modified poly(propylene-imine) dendrimers, which varied in size, structure, charge, and surface group composition. Several of the modified dendrimers, including an anionic glycodendrimer, reduced the level of protease resistant PrP(Sc) in a prion strain-dependent manner. This led to the formulation of a new working model for dendrimer/prion interactions which proposes dendrimers eliminate PrP(Sc) by destabilizing the protein and rendering it susceptible to proteolysis. This ability is not dependent on any particular charge of dendrimer, but does require a high density of reactive surface groups.

23240892|t|Acid-degradable cationic poly(ketal amidoamine) for enhanced RNA interference in vitro and in vivo.
23240892|a|Efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is one of major challenges in the successful applications of siRNA in clinic. In the present study, we report a new acid-degradable poly(ketal amidoamine) (PKAA) as a siRNA carrier, which has high delivery efficiency and low cytotoxicity. PKAA was designed to have acid-cleavable ketal linkages in the backbone of cationic biodegradable poly(amidoamine). PKAA efficiently self-assembled with siRNA to form nanocomplexes with a diameter of ~200 nm and slightly positive charges, which are stable under physiological conditions, but rapidly release siRNA at acidic pH. PKAA exhibited sufficient buffering capability and endosomolytic activity due mainly to the presence of secondary amine groups in its backbone and rapid degradation in acidic endosomes, leading to the enhanced release of siRNA to cytoplasm. Cell culture studies demonstrated that PKAA is capable of delivering anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α siRNA to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and significantly inhibits the expression of TNF-α. A mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure was used to evaluate in vivo siRNA delivery efficacy of PKAA. PKAA/anti-TNF-α siRNA nanocomplexes significantly reduced the ALT (alanine transaminase) and the hepatic cellular damages in APAP-intoxicated mice. We anticipate that acid-degradable PKAA has great potential as siRNA carriers based on its excellent biocompatibility, pH sensitivity, potential endosomolytic activity, and high delivery efficiency.

23246481|t|Wogonin inhibits H2O2-induced vascular permeability through suppressing the phosphorylation of caveolin-1.
23246481|a|Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and β-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.

23254198|t|Inhibitory effects of a bazedoxifene/conjugated equine estrogen combination on human breast cancer cells in vitro.
23254198|a|Breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone. The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen. Combination of bazedoxifene (BZA) with conjugated estrogens (CEs), the first TSEC, has shown beneficial effects. Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear. To address this issue, we compared estradiol (E(2)) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2). Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK, Akt, and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin, Bcl-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, These effects could be completely blocked by BZA. Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc, pS2, and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2, whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2). BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone. Our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of E(2) or CE on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by BZA. These studies imply that the CE/BZA, TSEC, exerts antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer cells and might block the growth of occult breast neoplasms in postmenopausal women, resulting in an overall reduction in tumor incidence.

23257735|t|Characterization of steroidogenic enzyme expression in aldosterone-producing adenoma: a comparison with various human adrenal tumors.
23257735|a|We analyzed the expression profiles of several steroidogenic enzymes in normal adrenals, aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), cortisol-producing adenomas combined with Cushing's syndrome (CPA) or with subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCPA), and nonfunctioning adrenal adenomas (NFA) to clarify the nature and characteristics of steroidogenesis in APA. Clinical data were collected for all subjects. In resected adrenal glands (normal adrenals, APA, CPA, SCPA, and NFA), the mRNA expression levels of the CYP17, HSD3B2, CYP11B1, and CYP11B2 genes were studied using real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The CYP11B2 mRNA level in APA was significantly higher than that in other groups. The CYP17/HSD3B2 ratio for mRNA in APA was significantly lower than those in the other groups. Low ratio of CYP17/HSD3B2 with high expression of CYP11B2 seems to explain steroidogenic characteristics of APA.

23261524|t|Live-cell imaging of p53 interactions using a novel Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation system.
23261524|a|p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules. Importantly, modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor, Mdm2, has been highlighted as a promising therapeutic target. In this regard, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells, offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions. In this study, we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells. We used nutlin-3, a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, to validate the specificity of the assay. The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation, PARP cleavage, and cell death. Finally, this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors. Our results constitute "proof-of-concept" that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies. Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies.

23261589|t|Salsolinol induced apoptotic changes in neural stem cells: amelioration by neurotrophin support.
23261589|a|Salsolinol (SAL), a catechol isoquinoline has invited considerable attention due to its structural similarity with dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Its high endogenous presence in Parkinsonian brain implicated its possible association with the disease process. SAL is also present in alcohol beverages and certain food materials and can get access to brain especially in conditions of immature or impaired BBB. Besides this, the effect of SAL on neural stem cells (NSCs) which are potential candidates for adult neurogenesis and transplantation mediated rejuvenating attempts for Parkinson's disease (PD) brain has not been known so far. NSCs in both the cases have to overcome suppressive cues of diseased brain for their survival and function. In this study we explored the toxicity of SAL toward NSCs focusing on apoptosis and status of PI3K survival signaling. NSCs cultured from embryonic day 11 rat fetal brain including those differentiated to TH(+ve) colonies, when challenged with SAL (1-100μM), elicited a concentration and time dependent cell death/loss of mitochondrial viability. 10μM SAL on which significant mitochondrial impairment initiated was further used to study mechanism of toxicity. Morphological impairment, enhanced TUNEL positivity, cleaved caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2:Bax suggested apoptosis. Sal toxicity coincided with reduced pAkt level and its downstream effectors: pCREB, pGSK-3β, Bcl-2 and neurotrophins GDNF, BDNF suggesting repressed PI3K/Akt signaling. Multiple neurotrophic factor support in the form of Olfactory Ensheathing Cell's Conditioned Media (OEC CM) potentially protected NSCs against SAL through activating PI3K/Akt pathway. This was confirmed on adding LY294002 the PI3K inhibitor which abolished the protection. We inferred that SAL exerts substantial toxicity toward NSCs. These findings will lead to better understanding of endogenous threats that might affect the fate of transplanted NSCs and their probable antidotes.

23261591|a|Paraquat (PQ) is a common herbicide and PQ poisoning is a major medical problem in Asia. However, few studies have focused on the acute neurotoxic changes caused by PQ. Here we report the acute neurotoxicological findings of rats treated with lethal dose of PQ. In substantia nigra (SN) and striatum we found obvious microglia (labeled by Iba-1) activation within one week. In SN and hippocampus, we detected increased oxidative stress in the neurons based on NeuN/8-OHdG immunofluorescence double labeling and laser cofocal microscopy. Moreover, we provided ultrastructural evidences of astrocyte edema and neurons apoptosis in rat brain by electron microscopy. Further studies will be needed with non-lethal dose of PQ to confirm these results and demonstrate the direct CNS toxicity of PQ.

23261676|t|(-) Epicatechin attenuates mitochondrial damage by enhancing mitochondrial multi-marker enzymes, adenosine triphosphate and lowering calcium in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.
23261676|a|Cardiac mitochondrial damage plays an important role in the pathology of myocardial infarction. The protective effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction were evaluated in rats. Rats were pretreated with (-) epicatechin (20 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 21 days. After the pretreatment period, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously into rats twice at an interval of 24 h to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats showed a significant increase in the levels of cardiac diagnostic markers, heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, calcium, and a significant decrease in the activities/levels of heart mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, isocitrate, succinate, malate, α-ketoglutarate and NADH-dehydrogenases, cytochrome-C-oxidase and adenosine triphosphate. (-) Epicatechin pretreatment showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters evaluated. The in vitro study revealed the superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of (-) epicatechin. The possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondria could be attributed to scavenging of free radicals, decreasing calcium, increasing multi-enzymes (antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes), reduced glutathione and adenosine triphosphate. Thus, (-) epicatechin attenuated mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.

23261757|t|Increased urinary excretion of albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and VDBP correlates with chronic sensitization to gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.
23261757|a|Drug nephrotoxicity is a serious health and economic problem worldwide. Rats can be acutely sensitized to acute kidney injury (AKI) by subnephrotoxic treatments with potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Acquired sensitization to AKI poses a silent risk impossible to diagnose pre-emptively with the technology available at the clinical level. Herein, we hypothesized whether a chronic, subnephrotoxic insult to the kidneys might result in chronically acquired sensitization to AKI, and whether chronic sensitization might be detected through specific urinary markers. To this end, rats were treated with a subtoxic dosage of the experimental nephrotoxin uranyl nitrate (UN) in the drinking water for 21 weeks, or plain water (as control), and then with low-dose gentamicin for 7 days. Renal function and renal tissue damage were evaluated through the experiment. The mild renal damage caused by gentamicin was markedly magnified in rats having received UN chronically, which was evident both at the functional and histological level. Four proteins, namely albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and vitamin D binding protein were increased in the urine in temporal association with the appearance of chronic predisposition. Although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that these proteins might be potentially used as markers of hidden, chronic predisposition to gentamicin nephrotoxicity, in order to appropriately and pre-emptively stratify and handle individuals according to their specific risk in the long term, and to conveniently optimize their life conditions or additional clinical procedures or treatments that might trigger the disease. This might reduce AKI incidence and severity and the associated costs.

23265459|t|Antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity of selenium exopolysaccharide produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
23265459|a|Exopolysaccharide (EPS) was isolated and purified from Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis culture broth. Selenium chloride oxide (SeCl(2)O) was added to the EPS to synthesize selenium-exopolysaccharide (Se-EPS). The in vitro and in vivo antioxidant and in vivo immunomodulatory activity of EPS and Se-EPS were compared. EPS and Se-EPS scavenged superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. They also increased catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum and in the livers of mice. Se-EPS showed stronger in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity than were shown by EPS. The in vivo immunoenhancement activity of EPS and Se-EPS induced by cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment in immunosuppressed mice was researched. EPS and Se-EPS treatments increased macrophage phagocytosis, spleen and thymus indices and haemolytic complement activity (HC(50)). Se-EPS showed stronger immunomodulatory activity than did EPS.

23265505|t|Influence of extraction procedures on phenolic content and antioxidant activity of Cretan barberry herb.
23265505|a|The main goal of present study was the development, optimization and application of different extraction protocols, especially those employing green technologies, in order to obtain from Berberis cretica extracts with high antioxidant capacity. For this purpose, the applied methods: maceration, ASE and SFE coupled with ASE were incorporated. The antioxidant assessment was carried out using DPPH and total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu) assays. Major constituents were elucidated using HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS/MS (hybrid IT-Orbital trap spectrometer) equipped with an ESI probe. The chromatographic and spectral data revealed the presence of several simple phenolic acids, derivatives of both caffeic and benzoic acids, and flavonoids in the produced extracts. It was clearly evidenced that the extraction method and solvents used affected both the activity and the chemical content of the results, significantly. The most beneficial conditions were calculated for methanol and water:ethanol (50:50) extracts derived from the combination of SFE and ASE methodologies. Obtained results classify Cretan barberry as a strong antioxidant agent.

23265539|t|Shelf-life of infrared dry-roasted almonds.
23265539|a|Infrared heating was recently used to develop a more efficient roasting technology than traditional hot air roasting. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the shelf-life of almonds roasted with three different approaches, namely infrared (IR), sequential infrared and hot air (SIRHA) and regular hot air (HA). Nine medium roasted almond samples produced by the aforementioned heating methods were processed at three different temperatures (130, 140 and 150 °C), packed in paper bags and then stored at 37 °C for three, six or eight months. Shelf-life of the roasted almonds was determined by measuring the changes in colour, peroxide value, moisture content, water activity, volatile components and sensory quality. No significant difference was observed in moisture content and water activity among the almond samples processed with different roasting methods and stored under the same conditions. GC/MS analysis showed that aldehydes, alcohols, and pyrazines were the main volatile components of almonds. Aliphatic aldehydes such as hexanal, (E)-2-octenal, and nonanal were produced as off-odours during storage. Although the overall quality of roasted almonds produced with SIRHA and HA heating was similar during the first three months of storage, their peroxide value and concentration of aliphatic aldehydes differed significantly for different roasting methods and increased significantly in all roasted samples during storage. We postulate that hexanal and nonanal might be better indicators of the shelf life of roasted almonds than the current standard, peroxide value.

23266270|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one mediated by suppression of inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.
23266270|a|To assess the potential therapeutic properties of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one (DPEP), its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. DPEP induced dose-dependent reduction of the protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and concomitant reduction in the production of NO and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Additionally, DPEP suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. We investigated the mechanism by which DPEP inhibits NO and PGE(2) by examining the level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is an inflammation-induced signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. DPEP inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Furthermore, DPEP inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor κB (IκB)-α and NF-κB p50. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that DPEP inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in macrophages.

23266271|t|Radioprotection by two phenolic compounds: chlorogenic and quinic acid, on X-ray induced DNA damage in human blood lymphocytes in vitro.
23266271|a|The present study was designed to determine the radioprotective effect of two phytochemicals, namely, quinic acid and chlorogenic acid, against X-ray irradiation-induced genomic instability in non-tumorigenic human blood lymphocytes. The protective ability of two phenolic acids against radiation-induced DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline comet assay in human blood lymphocytes isolated from two healthy human donors. A Siemens Mevatron MD2 (Siemens AG, USA, 1994) linear accelerator was used for irradiation. The results of the alkaline comet assay revealed that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid decreased the DNA damage induced by X-ray irradiation and provided a significant radioprotective effect. Quinic acid decreased the presence of irradiation-induced DNA damage by 5.99-53.57% and chlorogenic acid by 4.49-48.15%, as determined by the alkaline comet assay. The results show that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid may act as radioprotective compounds. Future studies should focus on determining the mechanism by which these phenolic acids provide radioprotection.

23267011|t|DNA polymerase minor groove interactions modulate mutagenic bypass of a templating 8-oxoguanine lesion.
23267011|a|A major base lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) that has ambiguous coding potential. Error-free DNA synthesis involves 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxoG adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. Left unrepaired the syn-8-oxoG/dAMP base pair results in a G-C to T-A transversion. During base excision repair of this mispair, DNA polymerase (pol) β is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxoG. To determine how pol β discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxoG, we introduced a point mutation (R283K) to alter insertion specificity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxoG. Structural studies with R283K pol β show that the binary DNA complex has 8-oxoG in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. Ternary complexes with incoming dCTP resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxoG base pairing with incoming cytosine. In contrast to wild-type pol β, the ternary complex of the R283K mutant with an incoming dATP-analogue and templating 8-oxoG resembles a G-A mismatched structure with 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation. These results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxoG conformation without minor groove DNA polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxoG while modulating fidelity.

23267840|t|NMDA and AMPA receptor mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rat: ameliorating effects of curcumin.
23267840|a|Functional activity of neurotransmitter receptor and their sensitivity to regulation are altered in DM. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of curcumin in glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Gene expression studies in diabetic rats showed a down regulation of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA leading to accumulation of glutamate. Radioreceptor binding assays showed a significant increase in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors density which was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Decreased glutathione peroxidases gene expression indicates enhanced oxidative stress in diabetic rats. This leads to decreased expression of glutamate aspartate transporter, which in turn reduces glutamate transport. All these events lead to excitotoxic neuronal death in the cerebral cortex, which was confirmed by the increased expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and BCL2-associated X protein. Curcumin and insulin treatment reversed these altered parameters to near control. We establish, a novel therapeutic role of curcumin by reducing the glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of diabetes through modulating the altered neurochemical parameters.

23274086|t|AMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect and suppresses tumor growth in vivo.
23274086|a|AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions, the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism is unknown. Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Genetic ablation of the α1 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Inactivation of AMPKα in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids, and biomass accumulation. These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), as silencing HIF-1α reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPKα signaling. Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation.

23281812|t|Tetrahydropyrroloquinolinone type dual inhibitors of aromatase/aldosterone synthase as a novel strategy for breast cancer patients with elevated cardiovascular risks.
23281812|a|The application of aromatase inhibitors to postmenopausal breast cancer patients increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is believed to be caused by the abnormally high concentrations of aldosterone as a consequence of the estrogen deficiency. Dual inhibitors of aromatase (CYP19) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) are therefore proposed as a novel strategy for the adjuvant therapy to reduce the CVD risk for these patients. By combining decisive structural features of CYP11B2 and CYP19 inhibitors into a common template, a series of pyridinylmethyl substituted 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-4-ones were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, the substituents on the methylene bridge showed strong influences on the inhibitory activities leading to opposite effects, that is, a given substituent showed an increase in inhibition of one enzyme, while it led to a decrease for the other enzyme. The compromise of this conflict led to compounds 3j, 3k, 3n, and 3p as potent and selective dual inhibitors of CYP19 and CYP11B2, especially compound 3p, which exhibited IC(50) values of 32 and 41 nM for CYP19 and CYP11B2, respectively, and a high selectivity toward CYP17 and CYP11B1. This compound is considered as a candidate for further evaluation in vivo.

23282066|t|Evaluation of animal models for intestinal first-pass metabolism of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes via in vivo and in vitro oxidation of midazolam and triazolam.
23282066|a|Abstract 1. To search an appropriate evaluation methodology for the intestinal first-pass metabolism of new drug candidates, grapefruit juice (GFJ)- and vehicle (tap water)-pretreated mice or rats were orally administered midazolam (MDZ) or triazolam (TRZ), and blood levels of the parent compounds and their metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. A significant effect of GFJ to elevate the blood levels was observed only for TRZ in mice. 2. In vitro experiments using mouse, rat and human intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions demonstrated that GFJ suppressed the intestinal microsomal oxidation of MDZ and especially TRZ. Substrate inhibition by MDZ caused reduction in 1'-hydroxylation but not 4-hydroxylation in both intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions. The kinetic profiles of MDZ oxidation and the substrate inhibition in mouse intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions were very similar to those in human microsomes but were different from those in rat microsomes. Furthermore, MDZ caused mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A-dependent TRZ 1'-hydroxylation in mouse, rat and human intestinal microsomes with similar potencies. 3. These results are useful information in the analysis of data obtained in mouse and rat for the evaluation of first-pass effects of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes.

23292249|t|The physico-chemical "anatomy" of the tautomerization through the DPT of the biologically important pairs of hypoxanthine with DNA bases: QM and QTAIM perspectives.
23292249|a|The biologically important tautomerization of the Hyp·Cyt, Hyp*·Thy and Hyp·Hyp base pairs to the Hyp*·Cyt*, Hyp·Thy* and Hyp*·Hyp* base pairs, respectively, by the double proton transfer (DPT) was comprehensively studied in vacuo and in the continuum with a low dielectric constant (ε = 4) corresponding to hydrophobic interfaces of protein-nucleic acid interactions by combining theoretical investigations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of QM theory with QTAIM topological analysis. Based on the sweeps of the energetic, electron-topological, geometric and polar parameters, which describe the course of the tautomerization along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC), it was proved that the tautomerization through the DPT is concerted and asynchronous process for the Hyp·Cyt and Hyp*·Thy base pairs, while concerted and synchronous for the Hyp·Hyp homodimer. The continuum with ε = 4 does not affect qualitatively the course of the tautomerization reaction for all studied complexes. The nine key points along the IRC of the Hyp·Cyt↔Hyp*·Cyt* and Hyp*·Thy↔Hyp·Thy* tautomerizations and the six key points of the Hyp·Hyp↔Hyp*·Hyp* tautomerization have been identified and fully characterized. These key points could be considered as electron-topological "fingerprints" of concerted asynchronous (for Hyp·Cyt and Hyp*·Thy) or synchronous (for Hyp·Hyp) tautomerization process via the DPT. It was found, that in the Hyp*·Cyt*, Hyp·Thy*, Hyp·Hyp and Hyp*·Hyp* base pairs all H-bonds are significantly cooperative and mutually reinforce each other, while the C2H…O2 H-bond in the Hyp·Cyt base pair and the O6H…O4 H-bond in the Hyp*·Thy base pair behave anti-cooperatively, i.e., they become weakened, while two others become strengthened.

23294326|t|Density of GM1 in nanoclusters is a critical factor in the formation of a spherical assembly of amyloid β-protein on synaptic plasma membranes.
23294326|a|The deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that the ganglioside-enriched microdomains (ganglioside clusters) in presynaptic neuronal membranes play a key role in the initiation of the Aβ assembly process. However, not all ganglioside clusters accelerate Aβ assembly. In the present study, we directly observed a spherical Aβ in an atomic force microscopic study on the morphology of a reconstituted lipid bilayer composed of lipids that were extracted from a detergent-resistant membrane microdomain (DRM) fraction of synaptosomes prepared from aged mouse brain. The Aβ assembly was generated on a distinctive GM1 domain, which was characterized as the Aβ-sensitive ganglioside nanocluster (ASIGN). By using an artificial GM1 cluster-binding peptide, ASIGN was found to have a high density of GM1; therefore, there would be a critical density of GM1 in nanoclusters to induce Aβ binding and assembly. These results suggest that ganglioside-bound Aβ (GAβ), which acts as an endogenous seed for Aβ fibril formation in AD brains, is generated on ASIGN on synaptosomal membranes.

23295740|t|Tamoxifen represses miR-200 microRNAs and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by up-regulating c-Myc in endometrial carcinoma cell lines.
23295740|a|Although tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been widely used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, its estrogen-like effect increases the risk of endometrial cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of TAM-induced endometrial carcinoma still remain unclear. In this report, we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in TAM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ECC-1 and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines and found miR-200 is involved in this process via the regulation of c-Myc. When treated with TAM, ECC-1 and Ishikawa cells were characterized by higher invasiveness and motility and underwent EMT. miR-200, a miRNA family with tumor suppressive functions in a wide range of cancers, was found reduced in response to TAM treatment. Consistent with zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2, which was confirmed as a direct target of miR-200b in endometrial cancer cell lines, some other key factors of EMT such as Snail and N-cadherin increased, whereas E-cadherin decreased in the TAM-treated cells, contributing to TAM-induced EMT in these endometrial cancer cells. In addition, we showed that c-Myc directly binds to and represses the promoter of miR-200 miRNAs, and its up-regulation in TAM-treated endometrial cancer cells leads to the down-regulation of miR-200 and eventually to EMT. Collectively, our data suggest that TAM can repress the miR-200 family and induce EMT via the up-regulation of c-Myc in endometrial cancer cells. These findings describe a possible mechanism of TAM-induced EMT in endometrial cancer and provide a potential new therapeutic strategy for it.

23296100|t|Manganese-induced oxidative DNA damage in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells: attenuation of thymine base lesions by glutathione and N-acetylcysteine.
23296100|a|Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element required for normal function and development. However, exposure to this metal at elevated levels may cause manganism, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with neurological symptoms similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Elevated body burdens of Mn from exposure to parental nutrition, vapors in mines and smelters and welding fumes have been associated with neurological health concerns. The underlying mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity remains unclear. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the toxic effects of Mn(2+) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Mn(2+) caused a concentration dependent decrease in SH-SY5Y cellular viability compared to controls. The LD50 value was 12.98 μM Mn(2+) (p<0.001 for control vs. 24h Mn treatment). Both TUNEL and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assays confirmed the induction of apoptosis in the cells following exposure to Mn(2+) (2 μM, 62 μM or 125 μM). In addition, Mn(2+) induced both the formation and accumulation of DNA single strand breaks (via alkaline comet assay analysis) and oxidatively modified thymine bases (via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis). Pre-incubation of the cells with characteristic antioxidants, either 1mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 1mM glutathione (GSH) reduced the level of DNA strand breaks and the formation of thymine base lesions, suggesting protection against oxidative cellular damage. Our findings indicate that (1) exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to Mn promotes both the formation and accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, (2) SH-SY5Y cells with accumulated DNA damage are more likely to die via an apoptotic pathway and (3) the accumulated levels of DNA damage can be abrogated by the addition of exogenous chemical antioxidants. This is the first known report of Mn(2+)-induction and antioxidant protection of thymine lesions in this SH-SY5Y cell line and contributes new information to the potential use of antioxidants as a therapeutic strategy for protection against Mn(2+)-induced oxidative DNA damage.

23297412|t|Resveratrol improves cardiomyopathy in dystrophin-deficient mice through SIRT1 protein-mediated modulation of p300 protein.
23297412|a|Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the α(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.

23298577|a|The present investigation was aimed at exploring dual targeting of anti-HIV drug, zidovudine (ZDV) via sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendritic nano-constructs. Fourth generation PPI dendrimers, sialic acid conjugated PPI dendrimers (SPPI), mannose conjugated PPI dendrimers (MPPI) and dual ligand system i.e. sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated PPI dendrimers (SMPPI) were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopies and were further confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry. Various parameters like drug loading, pH dependent in vitro release, hemolytic toxicity, macrophage uptake and cytotoxicity concerning PPI, SPPI, MPPI and SMPPI dendrimers were evaluated. ZDV loaded SMPPI, SPPI and MPPI have shown reduced hemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and in vitro drug release at pH 7.4. Extremely significant (P<0.001) increase in cellular uptake of ZDV by macrophage cells was observed in case of SMPPI as compared to PPI and free drug. The in vivo blood level and tissue distribution studies in albino rats also demonstrated potential of dual targeted system towards sialoadhesin and carbohydrate receptors. The drug concentration in lymph nodes was increased to about 28 times in case of SMPPI (1335 ± 17.6 ng/g) as compared to free drug (48 ± 5.8 ng/g) at 6th hr. The results suggested that such dual ligand dendritic system (SMPPI) hold potential to enhance biocompatibility and site specific delivery of antiretroviral drug, ZDV.

23299080|t|3D structures and ligand specificities of nuclear xenobiotic receptors CAR, PXR and VDR.
23299080|a|The nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) control a large array of genes that code for important proteins in humans including metabolic enzymes and transporters. 3D structures for the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of these receptors are abundantly available, providing valuable insights into the ligand-binding specificity as well as the activation mechanisms. The ligand-binding site of PXR is large and flexible, whereas those of CAR and VDR are compact and rigid, respectively. In general, the ligand profiles of the receptors are in agreement with the LBD structures. The crystal structures have greatly helped us to understand the promiscuity and/or specificity of CAR, PXR and VDR.

23305921|t|Synthesis and dual biological effects of hydroxycinnamoyl phenylalanyl/prolyl hydroxamic acid derivatives as tyrosinase inhibitor and antioxidant.
23305921|a|We previously reported that caffeoyl-amino acidyl-hydroxamic acid (CA-Xaa-NHOH) acted as both a good antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitor, in particular when caffeic acid was conjugated with proline or amino acids having aromatic ring like phenylalanine. Here, various hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives were further conjugated with phenylalanyl hydroxamic acid and prolyl hydroxamic acid (HCA-Phe-NHOH and HCA-Pro-NHOH) to study the structure and activity relationship as both antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors. When their biological activities were evaluated, all HCA-Phe-NHOH and HCA-Pro-NHOH exhibited enhanced antioxidant activity compared to HCA alone. Moreover, derivatives of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid inhibited lipid peroxidation more efficiently than vitamin E analogue (Trolox). In addition, derivatives of caffeic acid and sinapic acid efficiently inhibited tyrosinase activity and reduced melanin content in melanocytes Mel-Ab cell.

23307549|t|Ruxolitinib: a new treatment option for myelofibrosis.
23307549|a|Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Evolution of myelofibrosis can lead to life-threatening complications, including transformation to leukemia, thrombotic events, and hemorrhagic episodes. The only curative therapy for myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because this disease manifests primarily in the older population, many patients diagnosed with myelofibrosis are not considered medically fit for such aggressive therapy. Other available medical therapies do not halt disease progression; instead, current treatment strategies have focused on targeting specific symptomology, although with limited efficacy. The lack of effective treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis has rendered this orphan disease state an unmet medical need, and novel approaches to improve outcomes are necessary. Emerging research has identified numerous molecular mutations in patients with myelofibrosis, making this disease a potential candidate for molecularly targeted therapy. The most prevalent mutation identified is a gain-of-function mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) family, JAK2 V617F, which has been identified in more than half of patients with myelofibrosis. This mutation results in a constitutively active JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway resulting in dysregulated cellular proliferation and hematopoiesis. Ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 and recently became the first drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. In clinical trials, ruxolitinib demonstrated promising efficacy in reducing splenomegaly and myelofibrosis-related symptoms. However, ruxolitinib did not demonstrate disease-modifying potential and is not considered a curative therapeutic option. Adverse events associated with ruxolitinib are primarily hematologic, with thrombocytopenia and anemia being the most common toxicologic events identified. Future research will shed light on whether ruxolitinib in combination with other treatments will further enhance outcomes in myelofibrosis.

23312278|t|Tipping the energy balance toward longevity.
23312278|a|AMPK is a cellular energy sensor conserved across eukaryotes that in C. elegans prolongs life span and mimics dietary restriction. Stenesen and colleagues (2012) activate AMPK both directly and indirectly by altering AMP biosynthesis to slow aging in Drosophila, highlighting AMPK as a conserved life span modulator that links energy sensing to longevity.

23318731|t|Oxidative and nitrosative stress and apoptosis in oral mucosa cells after ex vivo exposure to lead and benzo[a]pyrene.
23318731|a|Exposure of human oral mucosa to lead (Pb) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) by inhalation and ingestion can lead to pathological conditions via apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress. However, few studies have investigated the effects of Pb and BaP on oral mucosa cells. Furthermore, previous studies focused on chronic Pb and BaP exposure. Therefore, we evaluated important markers of apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress in oral mucosa cells by incubating the cells with Pb and BaP for 5-360 min. Ex vivo samples of human oral mucosa were exposed to Pb or BaP, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate active caspase-3, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2a), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Pb and BaP treatments significantly increased active caspase-3 levels in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatments induced an early increase in 3-NT level, which ceased with longer incubation times. 8-Epi-PGF2a level increased only after prolonged incubation with Pb, and this elevation was irrespective of BaP incubation duration. Smokers' samples had significantly lower levels of markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress than did nonsmokers' samples. Thus, single, short-term exposure to Pb or BaP increases the levels of apoptosis markers and markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress.

23318833|t|Effect of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin on preneoplastic liver cell lesions induced by thioacetamide promotion in a two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model using rats.
23318833|a|To investigate the protective effect of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) on the hepatocarcinogenic process, we used a two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model in N-diethylnitrosamine-initiated and thioacetamide (TAA)-promoted rats. We examined the modifying effect of co-administration with EMIQ on the liver tissue environment including hepatic macrophages and lymphocytes and on the induction mechanism of preneoplastic cell apoptosis during early stages of hepatocellular tumor promotion. TAA increased the number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)(+) liver cell foci and the numbers of proliferating and apoptotic cells in randomly selected areas in liver sections. Co-administration with EMIQ suppressed these effects. TAA also increased the numbers of ED2(+), cyclooxygenase-2(+), and heme oxygenase-1(+) liver cells, as well as the number of CD3(+) lymphocytes. These effects were also suppressed by EMIQ. EMIQ increased liver levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells, death receptor 5 (DR5)(+) cells and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal(+) cells within GST-P(+) foci. Outside the GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells and DR5(+) cells. These results suggest that TAA-induced tumor promotion involves activation of hepatic macrophages producing proinflammatory factors. EMIQ may suppress the TAA-induced tumor-promoting activity by an anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by suppressing the activation of these macrophages. Furthermore, EMIQ may suppress tumor-promoting activity differentially between the inside and outside of GST-P(+) foci. Within GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ facilitates the apoptosis of preneoplastic cells through the upregulation of DR5. Outside the GST-P(+) foci, EMIQ suppresses apoptosis and the subsequent regeneration of non-transformed liver cells.

23319419|t|ICA-105574 interacts with a common binding site to elicit opposite effects on inactivation gating of EAG and ERG potassium channels.
23319419|a|Rapid and voltage-dependent inactivation greatly attenuates outward currents in ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) K(+) channels. In contrast, inactivation of related ether-a-go-go (EAG) K(+) channels is very slow and minimally reduces outward currents. ICA-105574 (ICA, or 3-nitro-N-[4-phenoxyphenyl]-benzamide) has opposite effects on inactivation of these two channel types. Although ICA greatly attenuates ERG inactivation by shifting its voltage dependence to more positive potentials, it enhances the rate and extent of EAG inactivation without altering its voltage dependence. Here, we investigate whether the inverse functional response to ICA in EAG and ERG channels is related to differences in ICA binding site or to intrinsic mechanisms of inactivation. Molecular modeling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis suggests that ICA binds in a channel-specific orientation to a hydrophobic pocket bounded by the S5/pore helix/S6 of one subunit and S6 of an adjacent subunit. ICA is a mixed agonist of mutant EAG and EAG/ERG chimera channels that inactivate by a combination of slow and fast mechanisms. With the exception of three residues, the specific amino acids that form the putative binding pocket for ICA in ERG are conserved in EAG. Mutations introduced into EAG to replicate the ICA binding site in ERG did not alter the functional response to ICA. Together these findings suggest that ICA binds to the same site in EAG and ERG channels to elicit opposite functional effects. The resultant agonist or antagonist activity is determined solely by channel-specific differences in the mechanisms of inactivation gating.

23319591|t|Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 by the lysine methyltransferase SET1 protein is needed for normal clock gene expression.
23319591|a|The circadian oscillator controls time-of-day gene expression by a network of interconnected feedback loops and is reset by light. The requisite for chromatin regulation in eukaryotic transcription necessitates temporal regulation of histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling enzymes for proper clock function. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. Based on this, we examined a strain lacking SET1 to determine the role of H3K4 methylation in clock- and light-mediated frq regulation. Expression of frq was altered in strains lacking set1 under both circadian- and light-regulated gene expression. There is a delay in the phasing of H3K4me3 relative to the peak in frq expression. White Collar 2 (WC-2) association with the frq promoter persists longer in Δset1, suggesting a more permissible chromatin state. Surprisingly, SET1 is required for DNA methylation in the frq promoter, indicating a dependence on H3K4me for DNA methylation. The data support a model where SET1 is needed for proper regulation by modulating chromatin at frq.

23321689|t|Activation of the α7 nicotinic ACh receptor induces anxiogenic effects in rats which is blocked by a 5-HT1a receptor antagonist.
23321689|a|The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is highly expressed in different regions of the brain and is associated with cognitive function as well as anxiety. Agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the α7 subtype of nAChRs have been shown to improve cognition. Previously nicotine, which activates both α7 and non-α7 subtypes of nAChRs, has been shown to have an anxiogenic effect in behavioral tests. In this study, we compared the effects of the α7-selective agonist (PNU-282987) and PAM (PNU-120596) in a variety of behavioral tests in Sprague Dawley rats to look at their effects on learning and memory as well as anxiety. We found that neither PNU-282987 nor PNU-120596 improved spatial-learning or episodic memory by themselves. However when cognitive impairment was induced in the rats with scopolamine (1 mg/kg), both PNU-120596 and PNU-282987 were able to reverse this memory impairment and restore it back to normal levels. While PNU-120596 reversed the scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, it did not have any adverse effect on anxiety. PNU-282987 on the other hand displayed an increase in anxiety-like behavior at a higher dose (10 mg/kg) that was significantly reduced by the serotonin 5-HT1a receptor antagonist WAY-100135. However the α7 receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine was unable to reverse these anxiety-like effects seen with PNU-282987. These results suggest that α7 nAChR PAMs are pharmacologically advantageous over agonists, and should be considered for further development as therapeutic drugs targeting the α7 receptors.

23322164|t|Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines.
23322164|a|Acylcarnitines are commonly used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (mFAODs). It is generally assumed that this plasma acylcarnitine profile reflects the mitochondrial accumulation of acyl-CoAs. The identity of the enzymes and the mitochondrial and plasmalemmal transporters involved in the synthesis and export of these metabolites have remained undefined. We used lentiviral shRNA to knock down the expression of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) in control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)-, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-, and plasmalemmal carnitine transporter (OCTN2)-deficient human fibroblasts. These cell lines, including mock-transduced controls, were loaded with decanoic acid and carnitine, followed by the measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium. In control fibroblasts, MCAD knockdown markedly increased the production of octanoylcarnitine (3-fold, P<0.01). OCTN2-deficient cell lines also showed extracellular accumulation of octanoylcarnitine (2.8-fold, P<0.01), suggesting that the cellular export of acylcarnitines does not depend on OCTN2. In contrast, in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells, the accumulation of octanoylcarnitine in the medium did not significantly increase in the MCAD knockdown. Similar results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of CPT2 in fibroblasts from MCAD-deficient individuals. This shows that CPT2 and CACT are crucial for mitochondrial acylcarnitine formation and export to the extracellular fluids in mFAOD.-Violante, S., IJlst, L., te Brinke, H., Tavares de Almeida, I., Wanders, R. J. A., Ventura, F. V., Houten, S. M. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines.

23324400|t|HOW GOOD IS THE LEVOTHYROXINE REPLACEMENT IN PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM PATIENTS IN BRAZIL?- DATA OF A MULTICENTRE STUDY.
23324400|a|Background : Studies done in every continent has shown that only around 50% of the patients subjected to thyroid hormone replacement have TSH in the normal range. However, until to date, there are no consistent data about Brazil. Objectives: To evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) replacement treatment in patients with primary hypothyroidism followed in referral centers in Brazil. Methods: Patients with primary hypothyroidism followed in referral centers (University Hospitals from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro -UFRJ, Unicamp, Universidade Federal do Paraná - UFPR and Universidade Federal do Ceará-UFC) answered a questionnairethat inquired about clinical and biochemical conditions, social-economic status, life quality and clinicians' orientations as well as their understanding about the information given. Serum TSH was checked close to the interview. Results: 2292 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age 51.2 years and TSH values between 0.4 and 4.0 mUI/l were considered to be within the reference range. Among all patients taking thyroid medication, 42.7%% had an abnormal serum TSH (28.3% were undertreated and 14.4% were over treated). Approximately all patients (99%) took LT4 in the morning but less than 30 minutes before breakfast (85.4%). Regarding the clinicians´ orientations: 97.5% of the patients were instructed to take the medication daily, and 92.6% to take 30 minutes before breakfast (92.6%). However, only 52.1% were told that not to take LT4 along with other medication. Conclusions: Our study found that there was a significant number of patients taking thyroid hormones were not in the therapeutic range. Clinicians should, therefore, consider monitoring patients on thyroid replacement more frequently and being more precise on giving recommendations about the correct use of LT4.

23327668|t|Bioactive abietane and ent-kaurane diterpenoids from Isodon tenuifolius.
23327668|a|Three new abietane diterpenoids, isoabietenins A-C (1-3), and 13 new ent-kauranoids, tenuifolins A-M (4-16), along with four known compounds (17-20), were isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon tenuifolius. The structures of the new metabolites were established on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of 1, 15, and 16 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Selected compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against a small panel of human tumor cell lines, and some compounds showed inhibitory effects. Furthermore, several isolates exhibited inhibitory activity against nitric oxide production in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages.

23327794|t|Alkaloids from Microcos paniculata with cytotoxic and nicotinic receptor antagonistic activities.
23327794|a|Microcos paniculata is a large shrub or small tree that grows in several countries in South and Southeast Asia. In the present study, three new piperidine alkaloids, microgrewiapines A-C (1-3), as well as three known compounds, inclusive of microcosamine A (4), 7'-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-[4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]propenamide (5), and liriodenine (6), were isolated from cytotoxic fractions of the separate chloroform-soluble extracts of the stem bark, branches, and leaves of M. paniculata. Compounds 1-6 and 1a (microgrewiapine A 3-acetate) showed a range of cytotoxicity values against the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. When evaluated for their effects on human α3β4 or α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), several of these compounds were shown to be active as nAChR antagonists. As a result of this study, microgrewiapine A (1) was found to be a selective cytotoxic agent for colon cancer cells over normal colon cells and to exhibit nicotinic receptor antagonistic activity for both the hα3β4 and hα4β2 receptor subtypes.

23331067|t|The transcription factor Pitx3 is expressed selectively in midbrain dopaminergic neurons susceptible to neurodegenerative stress.
23331067|a|The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is critical for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. Pitx3-deficient mice exhibit severe but selective developmental loss of mDA neurons, with accompanying locomotor deficits resembling those seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Here, we identify specific mDA cell subpopulations that are consistently spared in adult Pitx3-hypomorphic (aphakia) mice, demonstrating that Pitx3 is not indiscriminately required by all mDA neurons for their survival. In aphakia mice, virtually all surviving mDA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the majority of neurons in the adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) also express calbindin-D28k, a calcium-binding protein previously associated with resistance to injury in PD and in animal models. Cell-mapping studies in wild-type mice revealed that Pitx3 is primarily expressed in the ventral SN, a region particularly susceptible to MPTP and other dopaminergic neurotoxins. Furthermore, Pitx3-expressing SN cells are preferentially lost following MPTP treatment. Finally, SN mDA neurons in Pitx3 hemizygous mice show increased sensitivity when exposed to MPTP. Thus, SN mDA neurons are represented by at least two distinct subpopulations including MPTP-resistant Pitx3-autonomous, calbindin-positive neurons, and calbindin-negative Pitx-3-dependent cells that display elevated vulnerability to toxic injury, and probably correspond to the subpopulation that degenerates in PD. Impairment of Pitx3-dependent pathways therefore increases vulnerability of mDA neurons to toxic injury. Together, these data suggest a novel link between Pitx3 function and the selective pattern of mDA cell loss observed in PD.

23332762|t|Inactivation of BAD by IKK inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis independently of NF-κB activation.
23332762|a|The IκB kinase complex (IKK) is a key regulator of immune responses, inflammation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. The prosurvival function of IKK centers on activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, whose target gene products inhibit caspases and prevent prolonged JNK activation. Here, we report that inactivation of the BH3-only protein BAD by IKK independently of NF-κB activation suppresses TNFα-induced apoptosis. TNFα-treated Ikkβ(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo apoptosis significantly faster than MEFs deficient in both RelA and cRel due to lack of inhibition of BAD by IKK. IKK phosphorylates BAD at serine-26 (Ser26) and primes it for inactivation. Elimination of Ser26 phosphorylation promotes BAD proapoptotic activity, thereby accelerating TNFα-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and increasing mortality in animals. Our results reveal that IKK inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis through two distinct but cooperative mechanisms: activation of the survival factor NF-κB and inactivation of the proapoptotic BH3-only BAD protein.

23334403|t|Almorexant effects on CYP3A4 activity studied by its simultaneous and time-separated administration with simvastatin and atorvastatin.
23334403|a|PURPOSE: To characterise further the previously observed cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) interaction of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated (n = 14 healthy male subjects in two treatment groups) between almorexant at steady-state when administered either concomitantly or 2 h after administration of single doses of simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (40 mg). RESULTS: Almorexant dose-dependently increased simvastatin exposure (AUC(0-∞)) when administered concomitantly [geometric mean ratios (90 % CI): 2.5 (2.1, 2.9) (100 mg), 3.9 (3.3, 4.6) (200 mg)], but not C(max) [3.7 (3.0, 4.5) for both doses]. Time-separated administration resulted in relevant reductions of the interaction [AUC(0-∞): 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) (100 mg), 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) (200 mg); C(max): 1.5 (1.3, 1.9) (100 mg), 1.9 (1.6, 2.4) (200 mg)]. Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5). AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin decreased dose-independently [AUC(0-∞): 0.8 (0.8, 0.9) (100 mg), 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) (200 mg); C(max): 0.3 (0.3, 0.4) (100 mg), 0.2 (0.2, 0.3) (200 mg)] when atorvastatin was concomitantly administered. C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin slightly decreased (0.8 for both doses) following time-separated administration; AUC(0-∞) was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas almorexant increased simvastatin exposure dose- and relative time of administration-dependently, atorvastatin exposure increased to a smaller extent and irrespective of dose and time. This suggests that the observed interaction of almorexant with simvastatin is mainly caused by intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.

23339682|t|Assessment of effects of IR and IPC on activities of cytochrome P450 isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach.
23339682|a|Abstract Background and objective: To evaluate the effects of ischemia and reperfusion (IR) and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on the metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach. Methods: Cocktail approach was used to evaluate the influence of IR and IPC on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which were reflected by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of five specific probe drugs: caffeine, chlorzoxazone, tolbutamide, metoprolol and midazolam, respectively. Rats were randomly divided into IR, IPC and sham groups, and then injected the mixture of five probe drugs. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by a HPLC method with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. Results: The parameters including t(1/2β), CLs, AUC, MRT and K(10) exhibited a similar tendency for both IR and IPC groups. Compared with sham group, CLs and K(10) of five probe drugs were significantly lower (p < 0.05), AUC and t(1/2β) of five or some probe drugs were significantly increased in IR and IPC groups (p < 0.05). Compared with IPC group, CLs of five probe drugs were decreased and AUC were significantly increased in the IR group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: IR can variably decrease the activities of CYP isozymes in rats and this decrease can be attenuated by IPC.

23341458|t|The factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) enhances the activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2).
23341458|a|Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating protease involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, calcification, and fibrotic processes. To understand how FSAP controls the balance of local growth factors, we have investigated its effect on the regulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMP-2 is produced as a large pro-form and secreted as a mature heparin-binding growth factor after intracellular processing by pro-protein convertases (PCs). In this study, we discovered that FSAP enhances the biological activity of mature BMP-2 as well as its pro-form, as shown by osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. These findings were complemented by knockdown of FSAP in hepatocytes, which revealed BMP-2 processing by endogenous FSAP. N-terminal sequencing indicated that pro-BMP-2 was cleaved by FSAP at the canonical PC cleavage site, giving rise to mature BMP-2 (Arg(282)↓Gln(283)), as well as in the N-terminal heparin binding region of mature BMP-2, generating a truncated mature BMP-2 peptide (Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). Similarly, mature BMP-2 was also cleaved to a truncated peptide within its N-terminal region (Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). Plasmin exhibited a similar activity, but it was weaker compared with FSAP. Thrombin, Factor VIIa, Factor Xa, and activated protein C were not effective. These results were further supported by the observation that the mutation of the heparin binding region of BMP-2 inhibited the processing by FSAP but not by PC. Thus, the proteolysis and activation of pro-BMP-2 and mature BMP-2 by FSAP can regulate cell differentiation and calcification in vasculature and may explain why polymorphisms in the gene encoding for FSAP are related to vascular diseases.

23348754|t|A brief history of oxytocin and its role in modulating psychostimulant effects.
23348754|a|Over the past century, the polypeptide oxytocin has played an important role in medicine with major highlights including the identification of its involvement in parturition and the milk let-down reflex. Oxytocin is now implicated in an extensive range of psychological phenomena including reward and memory processes and has been investigated as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we first provide an historical overview of oxytocin and describe key aspects of its physiological activity. We then outline some pharmacological limitations in this field of research before highlighting the role of oxytocin in a wide range of behavioral and neuronal processes. Finally, we review evidence for a modulatory role of oxytocin with regard to psychostimulant effects. Key findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates a broad number of cocaine and methamphetamine induced behaviors and associated neuronal activity in rodents. Evidence also outlines a role for oxytocin in the prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) in both rodents and humans. Clinical trials should now investigate the effectiveness of oxytocin as a novel intervention for psychostimulant addiction and should aim to determine its specific role in the therapeutic properties of MDMA that are currently being investigated.

23349488|t|The type 2 diabetes associated gene Ide is required for insulin secretion and suppression of α-synuclein levels in β-cells.
23349488|a|Genome wide association studies have identified several type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci linked to impaired β-cell function. The identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, elusive. The HHEX/IDE T2D locus is associated with decreased insulin secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation in humans. Here we have assessed β-cell function in Ide knock-out (KO) mice. We find that glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is decreased in Ide KO mice due to impaired replenishment of the releasable pool of granules and that the Ide gene is haploinsufficient. We also show that autophagic flux and microtubule content is reduced in β-cells of Ide KO mice. One important cellular role for IDE involves the neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins and we find that α-synuclein and IDE levels are inversely correlated in β-cells of Ide KO mice and T2D patients. Moreover, we provide evidence that both gain- and loss-of-function of α-synuclein in β-cells in vivo not only impair GSIS but also autophagy. Together, these data identify the Ide gene as a regulator of GSIS, suggest a molecular mechanism for β-cell degeneration as a consequence of Ide deficiency, and additionally corroborates and extends a previously established important role for α-synuclein in β-cell function.

23349489|t|β-Cells Are Not Generated in Pancreatic Duct Ligation-Induced Injury in Adult Mice.
23349489|a|The existence of adult β-cell progenitors remains the most controversial developmental biology topic in diabetes research. It has been reported that β-cell progenitors can be activated by ductal ligation-induced injury of adult mouse pancreas and apparently act in a cell-autonomous manner to double the functional β-cell mass within a week by differentiation and proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) does not activate progenitors to contribute to β-cell mass expansion. Rather, PDL stimulates massive pancreatic injury, which alters pancreatic composition and thus complicates accurate measurement of β-cell content via traditional morphometry methodologies that superficially sample the pancreas. To overcome this potential bias, we quantified β-cells from the entire pancreas and observed that β-cell mass and insulin content are totally unchanged by PDL-induced injury. Lineage-tracing studies using sequential administration of thymidine analogs, rat insulin 2 promoter-driven cre-lox, and low-frequency ubiquitous cre-lox reveal that PDL does not convert progenitors to the β-cell lineage. Thus, we conclude that β-cells are not generated in injured adult mouse pancreas.

23353901|t|Support for 5-HT2C receptor functional selectivity in vivo utilizing structurally diverse, selective 5-HT2C receptor ligands and the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine elicited head-twitch response model.
23353901|a|There are seemingly conflicting data in the literature regarding the role of serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptors in the mouse head-twitch response (HTR) elicited by the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Namely, both 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists, regarding 5-HT2C receptor-mediated Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, reportedly attenuate the HTR response. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that both classes of 5-HT2C receptor compounds could attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in a single strain of mice, C57Bl/6J. The expected results were considered in accordance with ligand functional selectivity. Commercially-available 5-HT2C agonists (CP 809101, Ro 60-0175, WAY 161503, mCPP, and 1-methylpsilocin), novel 4-phenyl-2-N,N-dimethyl-aminotetralin (PAT)-type 5-HT2C agonists (with 5-HT2A/2B antagonist activity), and antagonists selective for 5-HT2A (M100907), 5-HT2C (SB-242084), and 5-HT2B/2C (SB-206553) receptors attenuated the DOI-elicited-HTR. In contrast, there were differential effects on locomotion across classes of compounds. The 5-HT2C agonists and M100907 decreased locomotion, SB-242084 increased locomotion, SB-206553 resulted in dose-dependent biphasic effects on locomotion, and the PATs did not alter locomotion. In vitro molecular pharmacology studies showed that 5-HT2C agonists potent for attenuating the DOI-elicited-HTR also reduced the efficacy of DOI to activate mouse 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PLC signaling in HEK cells. Although there were differences in affinities of a few compounds at mouse compared to human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors, all compounds tested retained their selectivity for either receptor, regardless of receptor species. Results indicate that 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in C57Bl/6J mice, and suggest that structurally diverse 5-HT2C ligands result in different 5-HT2C receptor signaling outcomes compared to DOI.

23361846|t|Role of cytochrome P4502B6 in methadone metabolism and clearance.
23361846|a|Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S > R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.

23363083|t|Computationally assisted assignment of kahalalide Y configuration using an NMR-constrained conformational search.
23363083|a|Assignment of the absolute configuration of cyclic peptides frequently yields challenges, leaving one or more stereogenic centers unassigned due to small quantities of sample and the limited utility of Marfey's or other methods for assigning amino or hydroxy acids. Here, we report isolation of kahalalide Y (1) from Bryopsis pennata for the first time; in addition, the application of a combination of molecular modeling and NOE distance constraint calculations was utilized to determine the conformation of 1 and the absolute configuration of the final stereogenic center of 1. Using the Schrödinger suite, the structure of 1 was sketched in Maestro and minimized using the OPLS2005 force field in Macromodel. A conformational search was performed separately for structures having an R or S configuration at C-3 of the beta-hydroxy fatty acid subunit that completes the cyclic scaffold of 1, after which multiple minimizations for all generated conformers were carried out. The lowest energy conformers of R and S stereoisomers were then subjected to B3LYP geometry optimizations including solvent effects. The S stereoisomer was shown to be in excellent agreement with the NOE-derived distance constraints and hydrogen-bonding stability studies.

23364612|t|Green approach&#8212;multicomponent production of boron&#8212;containing hantzsch and biginelli esters.
23364612|a|Multicomponent reactions are excellent methods that meet the requirements of green chemistry, by reducing the number of steps, and consequently reducing purification requirements. Accordingly, in this work, 11 novel hybrid-boron-containing molecules, namely eight 1,4-dihydropyridines and three 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones, derived from formylphenylboronic acids (ortho, meta and para), were obtained using a green approach, involving H-4CR and B-3CR practices, in the presence of ethanol, which is a green solvent, and using three comparatively different modes of activation (mantle heating, yield 3%-7% in 24 h, Infrared Radiation (IR) irradiation, yield 12%-17% in 12 h, and microwave irradiation, yield 18%-80%, requiring very low reaction times of 0.25-0.33 h). In addition, as a green-approach is offered, a convenient analysis, of the 12 green chemistry principles for the overall procedure was performed. Finally, since all the products are new, characterizations were carried out using common analytic procedures (1H, 11B, and 13C NMR, FAB+MS, HRMS, and IR). The accurate mass data of unexpected ions related to interactions between thioglycerol and the expected products, in the FAB+-mode, enabled unequivocal characterization of the target molecules.

23368996|t|Structures and cytotoxic evaluation of new and known acyclic Ene-Ynes from an American Samoa Petrosia sp. Sponge.
23368996|a|Four new compounds, (-)-petrosynoic acids A-D (1-4), and five known congeners, pellynols A (5), C (6), D (7), F (8), and I (9), were isolated from a Petrosia sp. marine sponge collected in American Samoa. Isolation work was guided by cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cells (H460). The structures of the C31-C33 polyacetylenes (1-9) were determined on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR analysis, mass spectrometry, and comparison of specific rotation values. Compounds 1-9 were found to be broadly cytotoxic with limited selectivity for cancer cells, as they were all moderately active against the A2058 (melanoma), H522-T1 (lung), and H460 (lung) human cancer cell lines as well as IMR-90 quiescent human fibroblast cells.

23373701|t|Dopamine D2 receptor activation leads to an up-regulation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor via Gβγ-Erk1/2-dependent induction of Zif268.
23373701|a|Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent growth factor essential to the development, survival, and function of dopaminergic neurons (Airaksinen and Saarma 2002). The molecular mechanisms underlying GDNF expression remain elusive; thus, we set out to identify a signaling pathway that governs GDNF levels. We found that treatment of both differentiated dopaminergic-like SH-SY5Y cells and rat midbrain slices with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonist, quinpirole, triggered an increase in the expression of GDNF that was temporally preceded by an increase in the levels of zinc-finger protein 268 (Zif268), a DNA-binding transcription factor encoded by an immediate-early gene. Moreover, the D2R inhibitor raclopride blocked the increase of both GDNF and Zif268 expression following potassium-evoked dopamine release in SH-SY5Y cells. We used adenoviral delivery of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Zif268 to down-regulate its expression and found that Zif268 is specifically required for the D2R-mediated up-regulation of GDNF. Furthermore, the D2R-mediated induction of GDNF and Zif268 expression was dependent on Gβγ-mediated signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Importantly, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we identified a direct association of Zif268 with the GDNF promoter. These results suggest that D2R activation induces a Gβγ- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent increase in the level of Zif268, which functions to directly up-regulate the expression of GDNF.

23373704|t|Fast protein motions are coupled to enzyme H-transfer reactions.
23373704|a|Coupling of fast protein dynamics to enzyme chemistry is controversial and has ignited considerable debate, especially over the past 15 years in relation to enzyme-catalyzed H-transfer. H-transfer can occur by quantum tunneling, and the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) has emerged as the "gold standard" descriptor of these reactions. The anomalous temperature dependence of KIEs is often rationalized by invoking fast motions to facilitate H-transfer, yet crucially, direct evidence for coupled motions is lacking. The fast motions hypothesis underpinning the temperature dependence of KIEs is based on inference. Here, we have perturbed vibrational motions in pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) by isotopic substitution where all non-exchangeable atoms were replaced with the corresponding heavy isotope ((13)C, (15)N, and (2)H). The KIE temperature dependence is perturbed by heavy isotope labeling, demonstrating a direct link between (promoting) vibrations in the protein and the observed KIE. Further we show that temperature-independent KIEs do not necessarily rule out a role for fast dynamics coupled to reaction chemistry. We show causality between fast motions and enzyme chemistry and demonstrate how this impacts on experimental KIEs for enzyme reactions.

23376217|t|Characterization of the mouse promoter region of the acyl-CoA synthetase 4 gene: role of Sp1 and CREB.
23376217|a|Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (Acsl4) is involved in several cellular functions including steroidogenesis, synaptic development and cancer metastasis. Although the expression of Acsl4 seems to be regulated by tissue- and cell-specific factors as well as pituitary hormones and growth factors, the transcriptional mechanisms involved remain unknown. We demonstrated hCG and cAMP regulation of Acsl4 mRNA in mouse steroidogenic MA-10 Leydig cells. We characterized the transcription initiation site and promoter of the Acsl4 mouse gene and identified three alternative splice variants present in MA-10 cells. Sequence analysis of a 1.5-kb fragment of the Acsl4 promoter revealed the absence of a TATA box and the presence of many putative binding sites for transcription factors including Sp1 and CREB. Functional characterization revealed that the specificity protein/Krüppel-like factor Sp1 binding site in the proximal promoter is involved in basal activity and that the cAMP response element-binding site is involved in cAMP stimulation of Acsl4 transcription.

23376249|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of 1,3,4-thiadiazole analogues as novel AChE and BuChE inhibitors.
23376249|a|In this paper a series of new 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives has been designed, synthesized and evaluated as the acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. Some analogues showed promising inhibition of both enzymes in vitro in the nM range. Generally, inhibitory potency of compounds was stronger against AChE than BuChE, and one of them was 1154-fold more active inhibiting AChE (IC50 = 0.17 μM) than BuChE. The kinetic studies showed that one of the most active analogues 8 (IC50 = 0.09 μM, AChE) acted as a non-competitive AChE inhibitor and was characterized by the high selectivity index (300). The other derivative (1) exhibited a mixed-type of AChE inhibition. Docking simulations enabled the detection of key binding interactions of the compounds with AChE and revealed that they occupied mainly the catalytic active site. The scoring function for the novel compounds was similar or higher than for the reference inhibitor. Additionally, based on Lipinski and other filters, the drug-likeness of compounds was assessed. They revealed that the compounds possess properties which can suggest the favourable pharmacokinetics in the human body after oral admission.

23376356|t|PI3 k/akt inhibition induces apoptosis through p38 activation in neurons.
23376356|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway is a pro-survival signalling system in neurons. Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.

23376546|t|Gender and strain contributions to the variability of buprenorphine-related respiratory toxicity in mice.
23376546|a|While most deaths from asphyxia related to buprenorphine (BUP) overdose have been reported in males, higher plasma concentrations of BUP and its toxic metabolite norbuprenorphine (NBUP) have been observed in females. We previously demonstrated that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) modulation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes highly to BUP-related respiratory toxicity, by limiting NBUP entrance into the brain. In this work, we sought to investigate the role of P-gp-mediated transport at the BBB in gender and strain-related variability of BUP and NBUP-induced respiratory effects in mice. Ventilation was studied using plethysmography, P-gp expression using western blot, and transport at the BBB using in situ cerebral perfusion. In male Fvb and Swiss mice, BUP was responsible for ceiling respiratory effects. NBUP-related reduction in minute volume was dose-dependent but more marked in Fvb (p<0.01 at 1mg/kg NBUP and p<0.001 at 3 and 9mg/kg NBUP) than in Swiss mice (p<0.001 at 9mg/kg NBUP). Female Fvb mice were more susceptible to BUP than males with significantly increased inspiratory time (p<0.05) and to NBUP with significantly increased expiratory time (p<0.01). Following BUP administration, plasma BUP concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.01) and plasma NBUP concentrations significantly lower (p<0.001) in Fvb mice compared to Swiss mice. Plasma BUP concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.05) and plasma NBUP concentrations significantly lower (p<0.01) in male compared to female Fvb mice. In contrast, following NBUP administration, comparable plasma NBUP concentrations were observed in both genders and strains. No differences in P-gp expression or BUP and NBUP transport across the BBB were observed between male and female Fvb mice as well as between Swiss and Fvb mice. Our results suggest that P-gp-mediated transport across the BBB does not play a key-role in gender and strain-related variability in BUP and NBUP-induced respiratory toxicity in mice. Both gender- and strain-related differences in respiratory effects of BUP could be attributed to BUP itself rather than to its metabolite, NBUP.

23380477|t|Autophagy takes place in mutated p53 neuroblastoma cells in response to hypoxia mimetic CoCl(2).
23380477|a|Solid tumors like neuroblastoma exhibit hypoxic areas, which can lead both to cell death or aggressiveness increase. Hypoxia is a known stress able to induce stabilization of p53, implicated in cell fate regulation. Recently, p53 appeared to be involved in autophagy in an opposite manner, depending on its location: when nuclear, it enhanced transcription of pro-autophagic genes whereas when cytoplasmic, it inhibited the autophagic process. Today, we used cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic that inhibits proteasomal HIF-1 degradation and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). We focused on CoCl2-induced cell death in a DNA-binding mutated p53 neuroblastoma cell line (SKNBE(2c)). An autophagic signaling was evidenced by an increase of Beclin-1, ATG 5-12, and LC3-II expression whereas the p53(mut) presence decreased with CoCl2 time exposure. Activation of the pathway seemed to protect cells from ROS production and, at least in part, from death. The autophagic inhibitors activated the apoptotic signaling and the death was enhanced. To delineate the eventual implication of the p53(mut) in the autophagic process in response to hypoxia, we monitored signaling in p53(WT)SHSY5Y cells, after either shRNA-p53 down-regulation or transcriptional activity inhibition by pifithrin alpha. We did not detect autophagy neither with p53(wt) nor when p53 was lacking whereas such a response was effective with a mutated or inactivated p53. To conclude, mutated p53 in neuroblastoma cells could be linked with the switch between apoptotic response and cell death by autophagy in response to hypoxic mimetic stress.

23382379|t|Mammalian myosin-18A, a highly divergent myosin.
23382379|a|The Mus musculus myosin-18A gene is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, α and β, with reported roles in Golgi localization, in maintenance of cytoskeleton, and as receptors for immunological surfactant proteins. Both myosin-18A isoforms feature a myosin motor domain, a single predicted IQ motif, and a long coiled-coil reminiscent of myosin-2. The myosin-18Aα isoform, additionally, has an N-terminal PDZ domain. Recombinant heavy meromyosin- and subfragment-1 (S1)-like constructs for both myosin-18Aα and -18β species were purified from the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. These constructs bound both essential and regulatory light chains, indicating an additional noncanonical light chain binding site in the neck. Myosin-18Aα-S1 and -18Aβ-S1 molecules bound actin weakly with Kd values of 4.9 and 54 μm, respectively. The actin binding data could be modeled by assuming an equilibrium between two myosin conformations, a competent and an incompetent form to bind actin. Actin binding was unchanged by presence of nucleotide. Both myosin-18A isoforms bound N-methylanthraniloyl-nucleotides, but the rate of ATP hydrolysis was very slow (<0.002 s(-1)) and not significantly enhanced by actin. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain had no effect on ATP hydrolysis, and neither did the addition of tropomyosin or of GOLPH3, a myosin-18A binding partner. Electron microscopy of myosin-18A-S1 showed that the lever is strongly angled with respect to the long axis of the motor domain, suggesting a pre-power stroke conformation regardless of the presence of ATP. These data lead us to conclude that myosin-18A does not operate as a traditional molecular motor in cells.

23382381|t|Supervillin-mediated suppression of p53 protein enhances cell survival.
23382381|a|Integrin-based adhesions promote cell survival as well as cell motility and invasion. We show here that the adhesion regulatory protein supervillin increases cell survival by decreasing levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and downstream target genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of a new splice form of supervillin (isoform 4) or both isoforms 1 and 4 increases the amount of p53 and cell death, whereas p53 levels decrease after overexpression of either supervillin isoform. Cellular responses to DNA damage induced by etoposide or doxorubicin include down-regulation of endogenous supervillin coincident with increases in p53. In DNA-damaged supervillin knockdown cells, p53 knockdown or inhibition partially rescues the loss of cell metabolic activity, a measure of cell proliferation. Knockdown of the p53 deubiquitinating enzyme USP7/HAUSP also reverses the supervillin phenotype, blocking the increase in p53 levels seen after supervillin knockdown and accentuating the decrease in p53 levels triggered by supervillin overexpression. Conversely, supervillin overexpression decreases the association of USP7 and p53 and attenuates USP7-mediated p53 deubiquitination. USP7 binds directly to the supervillin N terminus and can deubiquitinate and stabilize supervillin. Supervillin also is stabilized by derivatization with the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO1. These results show that supervillin regulates cell survival through control of p53 levels and suggest that supervillin and its interaction partners at sites of cell-substrate adhesion constitute a locus for cross-talk between survival signaling and cell motility pathways.

23384387|t|Novel acylethanolamide derivatives that modulate body weight through enhancement of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and/or decreased neuropeptide Y (NPY).
23384387|a|Newly synthesized acylethanolamide derivatives oleoyl-L-valinolamide (1), oleoyl-D-valinolamide (2), elaidoyl-L-valinolamide (3), elaidoyl-D-valinolamide (4) stearoyl-L-valinolamide (5), and palmitoyl-L-valinolamide (6) were investigated in mice as antiobesity compounds. Compounds 1, 2, 5, 6 significantly decreased body weight by 6.57% following eight injections of 1 mg/kg i.p. during 39 days, while 3 and 4 showed no such activity. Receptor binding indicated that no compound activated CB1, CB2, PPARα, or TRPV1 receptors. Hypothalamic RT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of the anorexigenic genes POMC and CART was up-regulated by 1, 2, 5 and 1, 2, respectively, while that of the orexigenic genes NPY and CaMKK2 was down-regulated by the respective compounds 1, 5, 6 and 1, 2, 5. Oleoyl-L-valinolamide enhances anorectic pathways and lead to decreased glucose levels, enhanced locomotor activity, and improved cognition. Effects of oleoyl-L-valinolamide on weight were dose-dependent, and it could be given orally. 1, 2, 4, 5 down-regulated FAAH mRNA expression.

23384447|t|Northern contaminant mixtures induced morphological and functional changes in human coronary artery endothelial cells under culture conditions typifying high fat/sugar diet and ethanol exposure.
23384447|a|It has been reported that Northern populations are exposed to mixtures of various environmental contaminants unique to the Arctic (Northern contaminant mixtures - NCM) at a large range of concentrations, depending on their geological location, age, lifestyle and dietary habits. To determine if these contaminants may contribute to a cardiovascular health risk, especially when combined with a high fat and sugar diet and ethanol exposure, we treated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with two mixtures of 4 organic (NCM1) or 22 organic and inorganic (NCM2) chemicals detected in Northerners' blood during 2004-2005 in the presence or absence of low-density lipoprotein (1.5mg/ml), very-low-density lipoprotein (1.0mg/ml) and glucose (10mmol/L) (LVG), and in the absence or presence of 0.1% ethanol. After 24h of exposure, cell morphology and markers of cytotoxicity and endothelial function were examined. NCM1 treatment did not affect cell viability, but increased cell size, disrupted cell membrane integrity, and decreased cell density, uptake of small peptides, release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), while causing no changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and nitric oxide (NO) release. In contrast, NCM2 decreased cell viability, total protein yield, uptake of small peptides, eNOS protein expression, and NO release and caused membrane damage, but caused no changes in the secretion of ET-1, prostacyclin and PAI. The presence of LVG and/or alcohol did or did not influence the effects of NCM1 or NCM2 depending on the endpoint and the mixture examined. These results suggested that the effects of one or one group of contaminants may be altered by the presence of other contaminants, and that with or without the interaction of high fat and sugar diet and/or ethanol exposure, NCMs at the concentrations used caused endothelial dysfunction in vitro. It remains to be investigated if these effects of NCMs also occur in vivo.

23385325|t|QM/MM simulations of vibrational spectra of bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2.
23385325|a|Channelrhodopsin-2 is a light-gated ion channel, which has been studied intensively over the last decade. Vibrational spectroscopic experiments started to shed light on the structural changes, that occur during the photocycle, especially in the hydrogen-bonded network surrounding the protonated D156 and C128 - the DC gate. However, the interpretation of these experiments was only based on homology models. Since then, an X-ray structure and better computational models became available. In this article, we show that in combination with a recent reparametrization, the approximate DFT method, DFTB, is able to describe the effects of hydrogen bonding on the C[double bond, length as m-dash]O stretch vibration in carboxylic acids reliably and agrees well with full DFT results. We apply DFTB in a QM/MM framework to perform vibrational analysis of buried aspartic acids in bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2. Using this approach, we can simulate the FTIR spectral difference between D115 in the dark-adapted and K states of bacteriorhodopsin. The FTIR experiments on the DC gate in channelrhodopsin-2 are well described using an indirect model, where D156 and C128 are bridged via a water molecule.

23386248|t|Refining the UGT1A haplotype associated with irinotecan-induced hematological toxicity in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil/irinotecan-based regimens.
23386248|a|Despite the importance of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 in irinotecan pharmacogenetics, our capability to predict drug-induced severe toxicity remains limited. We aimed at identifying novel genetic markers that would improve prediction of irinotecan toxicity and response in advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with folic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan (camptosar)-based regimens. The relationships between UGT1A candidate markers across the gene (n = 21) and toxicity were prospectively evaluated in 167 patients. We included variants in the 3'untranscribed region (3'UTR) of the UGT1A locus, not studied in this context yet. These genetic markers were further investigated in 250 Italian FOLFIRI-treated patients. Several functional UGT1A variants, including UGT1A1*28, significantly influenced risk of severe hematologic toxicity. As previously reported in the Italian cohort, a 5-marker risk haplotype [haplotype II (HII); UGTs 1A9/1A7/1A1] was associated with severe neutropenia in our cohort [odds ratio (OR) = 2.43; P = 0.004]. The inclusion of a 3'UTR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) permitted refinement of the previously defined HI, in which HIa was associated with the absence of severe neutropenia in combined cohorts (OR = 0.55; P = 0.038). Among all tested UGT1A variations and upon multivariate analyses, no UGT1A1 SNPs remained significant, whereas three SNPs located in the central region of UGT1A were linked to neutropenia grade 3-4. Haplotype analyses of these markers with the 3'UTR SNP allowed the identification of a protective HI (OR = 0.50; P = 0.048) and two risk haplotypes, HII and HIII, characterized by 2 and 3 unfavorable alleles, respectively, revealing a dosage effect (ORs of 2.15 and 5.28; P ≤ 0.030). Our results suggest that specific SNPs in UGT1A, other than UGT1A1*28, may influence irinotecan toxicity and should be considered to refine pharmacogenetic testing.

23386417|t|Androgen Receptor mRNA Measured by Quantitative Real Time PCR is Decreased in the Urethral Mucosa of Patients with Middle Idiopathic Hypospadias.
23386417|a|Androgen action is exerted through the androgen receptor. The normal 46,XY genital virilization depends on androgen receptor gene expression, which is tissue specific, and requires normal androgen receptor mRNA levels in androgen sensitive tissues. Hypospadias is a frequent male genital abnormality, potentially related to reduced androgen sensitivity in genital tissues. The aim of this study was to compare, by quantitative real time PCR, the amount of androgen receptor mRNA in cells obtained from the urethral mucosa of patients with middle idiopathic hypospadias with the androgen receptor mRNA levels observed in control phimosis subjects with eutopic urethral opening. Prepubertal individuals were studied, including 41 controls and 17 hypospadias patients with mean (SD) ages of 4.7 (2.1) years and 4.0 (3.0) years, respectively. We observed significantly less androgen receptor mRNA in the urethral mucosa of patients with hypospadias than in the controls (p=0.002). The correlation between the level of androgen receptor mRNA expression and the penile size was almost statistically significant only in hypospadias patients (r=0.47; p=0.053). We also established the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene by GeneScan analysis. No significant difference was observed in the number of CAG repeats when patients and controls were compared. A negative correlation between the CAG repeats and penile size was detected in patients with hypospadias, but not in controls. Our data suggest that a critical lower level of androgen receptor mRNA expression could be a determining factor in the development of middle hypospadias.

23389043|t|Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage in Human Gastric Carcinoma: 8-Oxo-7'8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) as a Possible Tumor Marker.
23389043|a|We characterized the oxidative stress (OS) status by the levels of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the mutagenic base 8-oxo-7'8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in human gastric carcinoma (HGC) samples and compared the results with normal tissue from the same patients. We also analyzed 8-oxo-dG in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC) and urine from healthy control subjects and in affected patients in the basal state and one, three, six, nine and twelve months after tumor resection. The levels of DNA repair enzyme mRNA expression (hOGG1, RAD51, MUYTH and MTH1) were determined in tumor specimens and compared with normal mucosa. Tumor specimens exhibited increased levels of MDA and 8-oxo-dG compared with normal gastric tissue. GSH levels were also increased, while GSSG levels remained stable. DNA repair enzyme mRNA expression was induced in the tumor tissues. Levels of 8-oxo-dG were significantly elevated in both urine and PMNC of gastric cancer patients compared with healthy controls. After gastrectomy, the levels of the damaged base in urine and PMNC decreased progressively to values close to those found in the healthy population. The high levels of 8-oxo-dG in urine may be related to the increased induction of DNA repair activity in tumor tissue, and the changes observed after tumor resection support its potential use as a tumor marker.

23391443|t|An intra-articular salmon calcitonin-based nanocomplex reduces experimental inflammatory arthritis.
23391443|a|Prolonged inappropriate inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to aspects of osteoarthritis (OA). The orphan nuclear receptor, NR4A2, is a key regulator and potential biomarker for inflammation and represents a potentially valuable therapeutic target. Both salmon calcitonin (sCT) and hyaluronic acid (HA) attenuated activated mRNA expression of NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 3 and 13 in three human cell lines: SW1353 chondrocytes, U937 and THP-1 monocytes. Ad-mixtures of sCT and HA further down-regulated expression of NR4A2 compared to either agent alone at specific concentrations, hence the rationale for their formulation in nanocomplexes (NPs) using chitosan. The sCT released from NP stimulated cAMP production in human T47D breast cancer cells expressing sCT receptors. When NP were injected by the intra-articular (I.A.) route to the mouse knee during on-going inflammatory arthritis of the K/BxN serum transfer model, joint inflammation was reduced together with NR4A2 expression, and local bone architecture was preserved. These data highlight remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of sCT and HA at the level of reducing NR4A2 mRNA expression in vitro. Combining them in NP elicits anti-arthritic effects in vivo following I.A. delivery.

23395804|t|Prolactin regulates transcription of the ion uptake Na+/Cl- cotransporter (ncc) gene in zebrafish gill.
23395804|a|Prolactin (PRL) is a well-known regulator of ion and water transport within osmoregulatory tissues across vertebrate species, yet how PRL acts on some of its target tissues remains poorly understood. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that ionocytes in the gill directly respond to systemic PRL to regulate mechanisms of ion uptake. Ion-poor conditions led to increases in the expression of PRL receptor (prlra), Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter (ncc; slc12a10.2), Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (nhe3b; slc9a3.2), and epithelial Ca(2+) channel (ecac; trpv6) transcripts within the gill. Intraperitoneal injection of ovine PRL (oPRL) increased ncc and prlra transcripts, but did not affect nhe3b or ecac. Consistent with direct PRL action in the gill, addition of oPRL to cultured gill filaments stimulated ncc in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect blocked by a pure human PRL receptor antagonist (Δ1-9-G129R-hPRL). These results suggest that PRL signaling through PRL receptors in the gill regulates the expression of ncc, thereby linking this pituitary hormone with an effector of Cl(-) uptake in zebrafish for the first time.

23397032|t|Parathyroid hormone (1-34) counteracts the suppression of interleukin-11 expression by glucocorticoid in murine osteoblasts: a possible mechanism for stimulating osteoblast differentiation against glucocorticoid excess.
23397032|a|Glucocorticoid (GC) excess causes a rapid loss of bone with a reduction in bone formation. Intermittent PTH (1-34) administration stimulates bone formation and counteracts the inhibition of bone formation by GC excess. We have previously demonstrated that mechanical strain enhances interleukin (IL)-11 gene transcription by a rapid induction of ΔFosB expression and protein kinase C (PKC)-δ-mediated phosphorylation of phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)-1. Because IL-11 suppresses the expression of dickkopf-1 and -2 and stimulates Wnt signaling, IL-11 appears to mediate at least a part of the effect of mechanical strain on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of PTH(1-34) and GCs on IL-11 expression in murine primary osteoblasts (mPOBs). PTH(1-34) treatment of mPOBs enhanced IL-11 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PTH(1-34) also stimulated ΔFosB expression and Smad1 phosphorylation, which cooperatively stimulated IL-11 gene transcription. PTH(1-34)-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was mediated via PKCδ and was abrogated in mPOBs from PKCδ knockout mice. Dexamethasone suppressed IL-11 gene transcription enhanced by PTH(1-34) without affecting ΔFosB expression or Smad1 phosphorylation, and dexamethasone-GC receptor complex was bound to JunD, which forms heterodimers with ΔFosB. High doses of PTH(1-34) counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on apoptosis of mPOBs, which was blunted by neutralizing anti-IL-11 antibody or IL-11 small interfering RNA. These results demonstrate that PTH(1-34) and GCs interact to regulate IL-11 expression in parallel with osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis and suggest that PTH(1-34) and dexamethasone may regulate osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis via their effect on IL-11 expression.

23400747|t|Effects of amlodipine on the oral bioavailability of cephalexin and cefuroxime axetil in healthy volunteers.
23400747|a|In this study, the authors compared the effects of amlodipine (AML) on the bioavailability of cephalexin (LEX) and cefuroxime axetil (CXM). Twenty-four healthy men were randomized to 4 treatments according to a crossover design with a 14-day washout. After an overnight fast, they were administered orally LEX 500 mg alone, LEX 500 mg 2 hours after oral administration of AML 5 mg, CXM 500 mg alone, and CXM 500 mg 2 hours after oral administration of AML 5 mg. All participants completed the whole study without side effects being observed. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by noncompartmental modeling with WinNonlin software. The geometric mean (GM) ratios were 1.38 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.45) for the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for LEX and 1.27 (1.18-1.36) for the maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)) for LEX followed by AML versus alone. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of CXM between treatments (P < .05). They authors conclude that AML possesses an enhancement effect in β-lactam antibiotic bioavailability (in this case, LEX), and this interaction may be specific to the peptidomimetic β-lactam antibiotics.

23402270|t|Binding between proteins and cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes: effect of pH, ionic strength, and stoichiometry.
23402270|a|Cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPBs) were synthesized by photoemulsion polymerization, consisting of a polystyrene core with a diameter around 80 nm and a poly(2-aminoethylmethacrylate hydrochloride) (PAEMH) shell with a thickness from 10 to 50 nm densely grafted on the core surface. The binding of various proteins onto SPBs was observed by turbidimetric titration, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding, aggregation, and releasing of proteins by SPB can be tuned by modulating pH. The pH regions of binding for bovine serum albumin (BSA), β-lactoglobulin (BLG), and papain onto SPBs are markedly different and tunable by ionic strength and stoichiometry between protein and SPB. Binding energetics, affinity, and amount of various proteins onto cationic SPBs were determined by ITC. These findings lay the foundation for SPB applications in the protein purification and selective immobilization of different proteins, enzymes, and antibodies.

23402856|t|Combined effects of organochlorine pesticides heptachlor and hexachlorobenzene on the promotion stage of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.
23402856|a|We aimed to investigate the combined effect of organochlorine pesticides heptachlor (HEP) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) by using a medium-term rat liver bioassay. Male F344 rats were initially administered diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200mg/kgi.p.); after a 2-week non-dosing period, they were given diets containing HEP (5 or 25ppm), HCB (70 or 350ppm), or their mixtures (5 and 70ppm or 25 and 350ppm) for 6weeks. All rats were subjected to partial hepatectomy at week 3 and killed at week 8. We observed additive or synergistic effects of HEP and HCB in groups treated with mixtures of these pesticides. Number and area of preneoplastic foci positive for glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) were consistently higher in these groups than the sum of individual values in the groups treated with HEP or HCB alone. Consistent with these findings, HEP and HCB had additive or synergistic effects on cell proliferation induction within the preneoplastic foci and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1 and 3A1 induction, which may lead to more efficient metabolic activation of HEP and HCB. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that HEP and HCB have additive and synergistic effects on the development of GST-P-positive foci and that higher risks are associated with a combination of residual organochlorine pesticides in foods than with individual residual organochlorine pesticides.

23403092|t|The food contaminant deoxynivalenol activates the mitogen activated protein kinases in the intestine: interest of ex vivo models as an alternative to in vivo experiments.
23403092|a|Trichothecenes induce changes in the intestinal barrier function through decreased expression of cell junction proteins and apoptosis of enterocytes. The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) play an important role in the signaling pathways of cell turnover and differentiation. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of low doses of DON to induce histological changes in the intestine and to activate the MAPK ERK 1/2, p38 and JNK. Twelve weaning piglets received during four weeks a control diet or a DON-contaminated diet (2.3 mg DON/kg feed). Six weaning piglets were used to prepare jejunal explants (ex vivo model). Explants were exposed during 4 h to vehicle, 5 or 10 μM DON. Intestinal changes were graded using a histological score. Pigs fed a DON-diet and explants exposed to DON showed a significant decrease in the jejunal score. In both models, the toxin significantly enhanced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and p38, whereas the increased phosphorylation of JNK was non significant. Taken together these results indicate that in vivo or ex vivo exposure of intestinal tissue to DON lead to similar intestinal lesions and activation of MAPK. These effects could impair the homeostasis of intestinal tissue in the aspects of barrier function and immune protection. The similarity of the in vivo and ex vivo results provides also strong evidence that the jejunal explant model is a good alternative for toxicological studies in intestinal tissue.

23403272|t|Paeoniflorin protects human EA.hy926 endothelial cells against gamma-radiation induced oxidative injury by activating the NF-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway.
23403272|a|Pulmonary endothelial cells have been demonstrated to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced lung injury. Our preliminary experiments indicated that Paeoniflorin protected human EA.hy926 endothelial cells from radiation-induced oxidative injury. This study was designed to confirm the protective effect of Paeoniflorin against radiation-induced endothelial cellular damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Preincubation of EA.hy926 cells with Paeoniflorin before γ-radiation resulted in significant inhibition of apoptosis, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced cell viability. In particular, we showed that Paeoniflorin significantly reduced the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and enhanced production of the endogenous antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in EA.hy926 cells. Treatment of these cells with Paeoniflorin significantly induced HO-1 expression. Moreover, Paeoniflorin promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-2 (Nrf-2). The Paeoniflorin-induced HO-1 expression was abrogated by Nrf2 siRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 with zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZNPP) significantly reversed the protective effect of Paeoniflorin against radiation-induced damage in EA.hy926 cells. Our findings confirmed that Paeoniflorin protected EA.hy926 cells against radiation-induced injury through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

23404093|t|Management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting : focus on newer agents and new uses for older agents.
23404093|a|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is associated with a significant deterioration in quality of life. The emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles, and patient risk factors significantly influence CINV. The use of a combination of a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist has significantly improved the control of acute and delayed emesis in single-day chemotherapy. Palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a different half-life, a different binding capacity and a different mechanism of action than the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appears to be the most effective agent in its class. Aprepitant, the first and only agent clinically available in the NK1 receptor antagonist drug class has been used effectively as an additive agent to the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone to control CINV. Rolapitant and netupitant are other NK1 receptor antagonists that are currently in phase III clinical trials. Despite the control of emesis, nausea has not been well controlled by current agents. Olanzapine, a US-FDA approved antipsychotic, has emerged in recent trials as an effective preventative agent for CINV, as well as a very effective agent for the treatment of breakthrough emesis and nausea. Clinical trials using gabapentin, cannabinoids and ginger have not been definitive regarding their efficacy in the prevention of CINV. Additional studies are necessary for the control of nausea and for the control of CINV in the clinical settings of multiple-day chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.

23406025|t|In vitro polyphenolics erythrocyte model and in vivo chicken embryo model revealed gallic acid to be a potential hemorrhage inducer: physicochemical action mechanisms.
23406025|a|The in vivo chicken embryo model (CEM) demonstrated that gallic acid (GA) induced dysvascularization and hypoxia. Inflammatory edema, Zenker's necrosis, hemolysis, and liposis of cervical muscles were the common symptoms. Levels of the gene hif-1α, HIF-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, and NFκB in cervical muscles were all significantly upregulated, while the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was downregulated in a dose-responsive manner. Consequently, the cervical muscle inflammation and hemolysis could have been stimulated en route to the tissue TNF-α-canonical and the atypical pathways. We hypothesized that GA could deplete the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the expense of semiquinone and quinone formation, favoring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce RBC disruption and Fe(2+) ion release. To explore this, the in vitro polyphenolics-erythrocyte model (PEM) was established. PEM revealed that the DO was rapidly depleted, leading to the release of a huge amount of Fe (II) ions and hydrogen peroxide (HPO) in a two-phase kinetic pattern. The kinetic coefficients for Fe (II) ion release ranged from 0.347 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1); and those for Fe (III) ion production were from 6.66 × 10(-3) h(-1) to 8.93 × 10(-3) h(-1). For phase I HPO production, they ranged from 0.236 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1) and for phase II HPO production from 0.764 h(-1) to 2.560 h(-1) at GA within 6 μM to 14 μM. Thus, evidence obtained from PEM could strongly support the phenomena of CEM. To conclude, GA tends to elicit hypoxia-related inflammation and hemolysis in chicken cervical muscles through its extremely high prooxidant activity.

23409765|t|Impact of quaternary structure dynamics on allosteric drug discovery.
23409765|a|The morpheein model of allosteric regulation draws attention to proteins that can exist as an equilibrium of functionally distinct assemblies where: one subunit conformation assembles into one multimer; a different subunit conformation assembles into a different multimer; and the various multimers are in a dynamic equilibrium whose position can be modulated by ligands that bind to a multimer-specific ligand binding site. The case study of porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) illustrates how such an equilibrium holds lessons for disease mechanisms, drug discovery, understanding drug side effects, and identifying proteins wherein drug discovery efforts might focus on quaternary structure dynamics. The morpheein model of allostery has been proposed as applicable for a wide assortment of disease-associated proteins (Selwood, T., Jaffe, E., (2012) Arch. Bioch. Biophys, 519:131-143). Herein we discuss quaternary structure dynamics aspects to drug discovery for the disease-associated putative morpheeins phenylalanine hydroxylase, HIV integrase, pyruvate kinase, and tumor necrosis factor α. Also highlighted is the quaternary structure equilibrium of transthyretin and successful drug discovery efforts focused on controlling its quaternary structure dynamics.

23411235|t|Antioxidant activity of phytosteryl phenolates in different model systems.
23411235|a|As part of a comprehensive study of the physiochemical and biological properties of phytosteryl phenolates, successfully synthesized chemoenzymatically in our lab, their antioxidant activity was evaluated using three different in vitro model systems, namely bulk oil model system, β-carotene-linoleate model system and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) oxidation assay. In the bulk oil system, phytosteryl phenolates showed similar or lower antioxidant activity compared with those of phenolic acids. However, in β-carotene-linoleate assay, an emulsion model system, phytosteryl phenolates showed enhanced antioxidant activity except phytosteryl ferulates. Moderate inhibitory effect of LDL-C oxidation by phytosteryl phenolates was observed. These findings demonstrate that use of multidimensional antioxidant activity determinations with differing reaction mechanisms is necessary to provide an overall understanding of the mechanisms of antioxidant action of phytosteryl phenolates.

23411251|t|Evaluation of antioxidant activities and chemical characterisation of staghorn sumac fruit (Rhus hirta L.).
23411251|a|Staghorn sumac (Rhus hirta L.) is a native tree in Eastern Canada whose fruit has been used by aboriginal peoples to treat various illnesses, and has recently been found to be a good source of antioxidants. However, the phytochemical composition of R. hirta is not known. In this study, we used Four highly accepted assays and confirmed its FRAP, ORAC, β-CLAMS and PCL values to be 79.95 μmol AAE/g DW, 1544 μmol TE/g DW, RAA 129% and 4513 μmol TE/g DW, respectively. The antioxidant activities correlated positively to the total polyphenols content, which was higher in the ethanolic extract (81.6 mg GAE/ g DW) compared to the water extract (46.3mg GAE/g DW), suggesting polyphenols play an important role. Quantitative data from UHPLC and qualitative studies using HPLC-DAD-MS showed that in addition to commonly found phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins, R. hirta fruit contained a novel group of unique anthocyanins with aglycones (anthocyanidins) at 449, 419 and 433 Da. Further studies on the identification and their health beneficial effects are being conducted.

23411279|t|Phenolics content and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of legume fractions.
23411279|a|Two faba bean (Vicia faba L.) subspecies major and minor and lentil seeds grown in Algeria were separated into cotyledons and hulls. These fractions, together with their corresponding whole seeds, were extracted with two solvents, aqueous (70%) acetone and (80%) ethanol, and evaluated for antioxidant activity in relation to their phenolic contents. Acetone selectively extracted tannins from faba beans. The hulls always exhibited high antioxidant activity, measured using the reducing power (RP), antiradical activity (DPPH) or oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. Aqueous ethanol (80%) extract of lentil hulls exhibited high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities preferentially inhibiting 15-LOX (IC(50), 55 μg/ml), with moderate COX-1 (IC(50), 66 μg/ml) and COX-2 (IC(50), 119 μg/ml) inhibitory effects on the COX pathway, whereas faba bean hull extracts exerted relatively mild LOX inhibitory activity.

23411280|t|Inhibitory activity of Filipendula ulmaria constituents on recombinant human histidine decarboxylase.
23411280|a|Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) catalyses the formation of histamine, a bioactive amine. Agents that control HDC activity are beneficial for treating histamine-mediated symptoms, such as allergies and stomach ulceration. We searched for inhibitors of HDC from the ethyl acetate extract of the petal of Filipendula ulmaria, also called meadowsweet. Rugosin D, rugosin A, rugosin A methyl ester (a novel compound), and tellimagrandin II were the main components; these 4 ellagitannins exhibited a non-competitive type of inhibition, with K(i) values of approximately 0.35-1 μM. These K(i) values are nearly equal to that of histidine methyl ester (K(i)=0.46 μM), an existing substrate analogue inhibitor. Our results show that food products contain potent HDC inhibitors and that these active food constituents might be useful for designing clinically available HDC inhibitors.

23414838|t|Discovery of a novel series of quinolone α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists.
23414838|a|High throughput screening led to the identification of a novel series of quinolone α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Optimization of an HTS hit (1) led to 4-phenyl-1-(quinuclidin-3-ylmethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one, which was found to be potent and selective. Poor brain penetrance in this series was attributed to transporter-mediated efflux, which was in turn due to high pKa. A novel 4-fluoroquinuclidine significantly lowered the pKa of the quinuclidine moiety, reducing efflux as measured by a Caco-2 assay.

23416002|t|Amino acid derived quinazolines as Rock/PKA inhibitors.
23416002|a|SAR and lead optimization studies for Rock inhibitors based on amino acid-derived quinazolines are described. Studies demonstrated that these amino acid derived quinazolinones were mainly pan-Rock (I & II) inhibitors. While selectivity against other kinases could be achieved, selectivity for most of these compounds against PKA was not achieved. This is distinct from Rock inhibitors based on non-amino acid derived quinazolinones, where high selectivity against PKA could be obtained.(22) The inhibitors presented here in some cases possessed sub-nanomolar inhibition of Rock, nanomolar potency in ppMLC cell based assays, low to fair cytochrome P-450 inhibition, and good human microsomal stability.

23416065|t|Human serum albumin-based design of a diflunisal prodrug.
23416065|a|The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, diflunisal, is used in the clinic for its anti-inflammatory activity. About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.

23423942|t|Use of gene expression data to determine effects on gonad phenotype in japanese medaka after exposure to trenbolone or estradiol.
23423942|a|Various aquatic bioassays using one of several fish species have been developed or are in the process of being developed by organizations like the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Economic Cooperation and Development for testing potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Often, these involve assessment of the gonad phenotype of individuals as a key endpoint that is inputted into a risk or hazard assessment. Typically, gonad phenotype is determined histologically, which involves specialized and time-consuming techniques. The methods detailed here utilize an entirely different methodology, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, to determine the relative expression levels of 4 genes after exposure to either 17β-estradiol or 17β-trenbolone and, by extension, the effects of EDCs on the phenotypic status of the gonad. The 4 genes quantified, Sox9b, protamine, Fig1α, and ZPC1, are all involved in gonad development and maintenance in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes); these data were then inputted into a permutational multivariate analysis of variance to determine whether significant differences exist between treatment groups. This information in conjunction with the sexual genotype, which can be determined in medaka, can be used to determine adverse effects of exposure to EDCs in a similar fashion to the histologically determined gonad phenotype.

23423972|t|Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine in B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus).
23423972|a|Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation are 3 critical aspects affecting toxicant action in animals. In the present study, B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus) were exposed for 28 d to contaminated feed that contained 1 of 5 different hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) concentrations: 0 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg. The authors quantified RDX and its reductive transformation products hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (TNX) in the stomach, intestine, plasma, liver, and brain of these mice. Average RDX concentrations followed a dose-dependent pattern for all matrices tested. No controls had concentrations above limits of detection. Average RDX concentrations in tissues of exposed mice ranged from 11.1 ng/mL to 182 ng/mL, 25.6 ng/g to 3319 ng/g, 123 ng/g to 233 ng/g, 144 ng/g to 35 900 ng/g, and 51.1 ng/g to 2697 ng/g in the plasma, brain, liver, stomach, and intestine, respectively. A considerable amount of RDX was present in the brain, especially in the highest-exposure group. This is consistent with the widely observed central nervous system effects caused by γ-aminobutyric acid inhibition associated with RDX exposure. N-nitroso metabolites of RDX were also present in tested tissues in a dose-dependent pattern. Average MNX concentrations in the stomachs of mice exposed to RDX ranged from nondetectable in control exposures to 490 ng/g in the highest-exposure groups. In the brain, MNX accumulated at a maximum average concentration of 165.1 ng/g, suggesting the potential formation of MNX from RDX within the brain. At higher exposures, DNX and TNX were present in the stomach, plasma, and brain of mice. The presence of RDX metabolites at notable amounts in different tissues suggests that RDX can transform into its N-nitroso metabolites in vivo by an undefined mechanism.

23424204|a|The estrogenic monomer bisphenol-A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical used in the production of epoxy resins, plastic food and beverage containers, leading to ubiquitous human exposure. Environmentally relevant doses of BPA have profound effects on mice endocrine pancreas. It increases pancreatic insulin content and favors postprandial hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in male mice. Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic glucose metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the possible effects of BPA on insulin-signaling molecules and glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of male rat. Adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups. Group I: control (vehicle treated) and groups II and III were administered with BPA orally (20 and 200 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Although there was no change in the levels of insulin receptor (IR), Akt (protein kinase B) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) messenger RNA, BPA significantly decreased the IR, Akt and GLUT4 protein levels (both plasma membrane and cytosolic fraction) of the gastrocnemius muscle. There was an increase in serum insulin and decrease in serum testosterone levels but fasting blood glucose level remained unaltered. In conclusion, BPA has adverse effects on phosphorylation of Akt, GLUT4 translocation and (14)C-glucose oxidation.

23424207|t|Rutin- and Selenium-attenuated cadmium-induced testicular pathophysiology in rats.
23424207|a|Cadmium (Cd) is known to cause oxidative damage in the testes of rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of rutin (RUT, 30 mg/kg) and selenium (Se, 0.15 ppm) alone or in combination against Cd (200 ppm)-induced lipid peroxidation, steroidogenesis and changes in antioxidant defence system in the rat testes. The obtained results showed that Cd increased lipid peroxidation and abnormal sperm count and decreased plasma testosterone, lactate dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and testicular steroidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), 17β-HSD activities as well as epididymal sperm counts and motility, while RUT and Se treatment reversed this change to control values. Acute intoxication with Cd was also followed by significantly decreased activity of the antioxidant defence system (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)). Treatment with RUT and Se reversed Cd-induced alterations of antioxidant defence system and significantly prevented Cd-induced testes damage and depletion of plasma and testicular Se levels. RUT and Se appear not to have more profound effects than their separate effects against Cd-induced testicular toxicity, although Se was more potent than RUT in the recovery of testosterone levels. These results suggest that both RUT and Se do not have synergistic role against Cd-induced testicular injury.

23425605|t|The role of de novo catecholamine synthesis in mediating methylmercury-induced vesicular dopamine release from rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.
23425605|a|The purpose of this study was to characterize methylmercury (MeHg)-induced dopamine (DA) release from undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and to examine the potential role for DA synthesis in this process. MeHg caused a significant increase in DA release that was both concentration- and time-dependent. DA release was significantly increased by 2µM MeHg at 60min and by 5µM MeHg at 30min; 1µM MeHg was without effect. Because DA release induced by 5µM MeHg was associated with a significant percentage of cell death at 60 and 120min, 2µM MeHg was chosen for further characterization of release mechanisms. MeHg-induced DA release was attenuated but not abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium, whereas the vesicular content depleting drug reserpine (50nM) abolished release. Thus, MeHg-induced DA release requires vesicular exocytosis but not extracellular calcium. MeHg also increased intracellular DA and the rate of DA storage utilization, suggesting a role for DA synthesis in MeHg-induced DA release. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor α-methyltyrosine (300µM, 24h) completely abolished MeHg-induced DA release. MeHg significantly increased DA precursor accumulation in cells treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (10µM), revealing that MeHg increases tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Overall, these data demonstrate that MeHg facilitates DA synthesis, increases intracellular DA, and augments vesicular exocytosis.

23428155|t|Solubility-driven optimization of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones leading to a promising antibacterial agent.
23428155|a|The solubility-driven structural modification of (pyridin-3-yl) benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones is described, which resulted in the development of a new series of benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinone analogues with high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including that against linezolid-resistant strains and low hERG inhibition. With regard to structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends among the various substituents on the pyridyl ring, relatively small and nonbasic substituents were preferable to sterically demanding or basic substituents. Oxazolidinone ring substitution on the pyridyl ring generated analogues with antibacterial activity superior to imidazolidinone ring. Solubility was enhanced by the incorporation of polar groups, especially when compounds were converted to their prodrugs. Among the prodrugs, compound 85 exhibited excellent solubility and a good pharmacokinetic profile. In a MRSA systemic infection model, compound 85 displayed an ED50 = 5.00 mg/kg, a potency that is 2-fold better than that of linezolid.

23430109|t|Activity of ponatinib against clinically-relevant AC220-resistant kinase domain mutants of FLT3-ITD.
23430109|a|Secondary point mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinase domain (KD) are common causes of acquired clinical resistance to the FLT3 inhibitors AC220 (quizartinib) and sorafenib. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and clinical activity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia, irrespective of BCR-ABL KD mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 "gatekeeper" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naive and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted. Alternative strategies will be required for patients with TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD D835 mutations.

23432582|t|Bisacylimidoselenocarbamates Cause G2/M Arrest Associated with the Modulation of CDK1 and Chk2 in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells.
23432582|a|Bisacylimidoselenocarbamate derivatives (BSC) are potent anticancer agents with a strong cytotoxic activity against different types of tumour cells. Based in phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell membranes we show that BSC treatment resulted in enhanced cell death in leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells. DNA fragmentation detection in breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells showed that BSC triggered cell death is concentration and time dependent. We also show that two of these compounds, BSC 3g and 3n, cause cell-cycle arrest in the late G2/M in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with this, a reduction in CDK1 and CDK2 expression with no change in cyclin A an B1 was observed in this cell line. Activation of caspase-2 was also detected. However, the involvement of the caspase-dependent pathway in the process of cell death induced by either BSC 3g or 3n is discarded since cell death could not be prevented by pretreatment with the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Moreover, since reduced levels of p21CIP1 and Chk2 proteins but no change in p53 levels could be detected in MCF-7 cells after BSC 3g or 3n treatment our results suggest that BSC treated cells die from lethal mitosis.

23434223|t|A one-pot domino synthesis and discovery of highly functionalized dihydrobenzo[b]thiophenes as AChE inhibitors.
23434223|a|A library of novel 5-amino-2,7-diaryl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-4,6-dicarbonitriles have been synthesized regioselectively in good yields through the one-pot domino reactions of 5-aryldihydro-3(2H)-thiophenones, malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes in the presence of morpholine. This transformation presumably involves Knoevenagel condensation-Michael addition-intramolecular Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization-Tautomerization-Elimination sequence of reactions. These compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and 5-amino-2,7-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-4,6-dicarbonitrile was found to be the most potent against AChE with IC50 4.16 μmol/L.

23434640|t|Synthesis and cytotoxicity of 3-aryl acrylic amide derivatives of the simplified saframycin-ecteinascidin skeleton prepared from l-dopa.
23434640|a|Twenty four compounds with diversified 3-aryl acrylic amide side chains of the simplified saframycin-ecteinascidin pentacyclic skeleton were synthesized via a 14-step stereospecific route starting from l-dopa. The cytotoxicities of these compounds were tested against eight human tumor cell lines including HCT-8, BEL-7402, BGC-803, A549, A2780, MCF-7, MX-1, and MDA-MB-231. Most of these compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity, and a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) was discussed. Compound 28 with 3-thiophenyl acrylic amide side chain exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cell line with the IC50 value of 50 nM.

23434829|t|Upregulation of drug transporter expression by osteopontin in prostate cancer cells.
23434829|a|Multidrug resistance is a major cause of chemotherapy failure. Recent studies indicate that drug resistance can be rapidly induced by some soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and cell adhesion factors in the tumor microenvironment. Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix protein, has a functional arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) domain for binding to integrin. Here we found OPN expression to be upregulated by hypoxic condition in PC-3 prostate tumor cells. OPN increased the mRNA and protein expression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), a subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporter in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The increase in P-gp transporter by OPN was mediated by binding to αvβ3 integrin. Daunomycin (DUN), a chemotherapeutic agent with autofluorescence, was used to evaluate the pump activity, and OPN increased the drug pumping-out activity. OPN inhibited DUN-induced cell death, which was antagonized by αvβ3 monoclonal antibody. Long-term treatment with DUN further enhanced the expression of OPN. Knockdown of endogenous OPN potentiated the DUN-induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of OPN enhanced cell death caused by other drugs, including paclitaxel, doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, and rapamycin, which are also P-gp substrates. The animal studies also showed that OPN knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic action of DUN. These results indicate that OPN is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy to reduce drug resistance in sensitive tumors.

23436791|t|A combination strategy to inhibit Pim-1: synergism between noncompetitive and ATP-competitive inhibitors.
23436791|a|Pim-1 is a serine/threonine kinase critically involved in the initiation and progression of various types of cancer, especially leukemia, lymphomas and solid tumors such as prostate, pancreas and colon, and is considered a potential drug target against these malignancies. In an effort to discover new potent Pim-1 inhibitors, a previously identified ATP-competitive indolyl-pyrrolone scaffold was expanded to derive structure-activity relationship data. A virtual screening campaign was also performed, which led to the discovery of additional ATP-competitive inhibitors as well as a series of 2-aminothiazole derivatives, which are noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and peptide substrate. This mechanism of action, which resembles allosteric inhibition, has not previously been characterized for Pim-1. Notably, further evaluation of the 2-aminothiazoles indicated a synergistic inhibitory effect in enzymatic assays when tested in combination with ATP-competitive inhibitors. A synergistic effect in the inhibition of cell proliferation by ATP-competitive and ATP-noncompetitive compounds was also observed in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3), where all Pim-1 inhibitors tested in showed synergism with the known anticancer agent, paclitaxel. These results further establish Pim-1 as a target in cancer therapy, and highlight the potential of these agents for use as adjuvant agents in the treatment of cancer diseases in which Pim-1 is associated with chemotherapeutic resistance.

23443628|t|A population-based study of dosing and persistence with anti-dementia medications.
23443628|a|PURPOSE: Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are the mainstay of pharmacological intervention for the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed the adequacy of dosing and persistence with AD medications and the predictors of these variables in the 'real world' (outside the clinical trial setting). METHODS: The Health Service Executive-Primary Care Reimbursement Services prescription claims database in the Republic of Ireland contains prescription information for 1.6 million people. Patients aged >70 years who received at least two prescriptions for donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine between January 2006 and December 2010 were included in the study. Rates of dose-maximisation were recorded by examining the initiation dose of each AD drug commenced during the study period and any subsequent dose titrations. Non-persistence was defined by a gap in prescribing of more than 63 consecutive days. Predictors of dose-maximisation and non-persistence were also analysed. RESULTS: Between January 2006 and December 2010, 20,729 patients aged >70 years received a prescription for an AD medication. Despite most patients on donepezil and memantine receiving a prescription for the maximum drug dose, this dose was maintained for 2 consecutive months in only two-thirds of patients. Patients were significantly more likely to have their doses of donepezil and memantine maximised if prescribed in more recent years (2010 vs. 2007). Rates of non-persistence were 30.1 % at 6 months and 43.8 % at 12 months. Older age [75+ vs. <75 years; hazards ratio (HR) 1.16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.27] and drug type (rivastigmine vs. donepezil; HR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.03-1.27) increased the risk of non-persistence. Non-persistence was lower for those commencing therapy in more recent years (2010 vs. 2007; HR 0.81, 95 % CI 0.73-0.89, p < 0.001) and for those on multiple anti-dementia medications (HR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.54-0.65, p < 0.001). Persistence was significantly higher when memantine was co-prescribed with donepezil (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Future studies should explore the reasons underlying non-persistence and failure to maintain dose-maximisation in patients on AD medications. There may be scope to improve the dosing and persistence with these medications in the community.

23452205|t|mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators: a patent review (2009 - present).
23452205|a|Introduction: The mGlu2 receptor, which belongs to the group II subfamily of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu) along with the mGlu3 receptor, has proven to be of particular importance in neuropharmacology. Preferentially expressed on presynaptic nerve terminals, the mGlu2 receptor negatively modulates glutamate and GABA release and is widely distributed in the brain. High levels of mGlu2 receptors are seen in brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala where glutamate hyperfunction may be implicated in disorders and diseases such as anxiety and schizophrenia. Given the promise offered by mGlu2/3 receptor activation, there is increased interest in identifying small molecules which activate the receptor. A preferred approach is via positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) which bind at an alternative site to agonists. Areas covered: This review covers the patent applications which were published between April 2009 and December 2012 on PAMs of the mGlu2, and it is a continuation of an earlier review published in this journal. Expert opinion: Advances in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology have set the stage in the field of mGlu2 receptor PAMs. Compounds currently advancing in clinical trials will soon establish the therapeutic potential of this allosteric approach.

23454148|t|Effect of protein malnutrition on the metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in rat stomach.
23454148|a|This study investigated the effect of protein malnutrition on metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin (CP), 5-fluorouracil (FU) and mitomycin C (MMC) in rat stomach. Weanling male Wistar rats received a normal (24%) or low (2.5%) protein diet for 28days and were allocated into: normally-fed control, protein-malnourished control (PM), 3 normally-fed drug-treated groups and 3 protein-malnourished drug-treated groups (PM-CP, PM-FU and PM-MMC). Cisplatin and MMC were injected intraperitoneally (8mg/kg on day 26 and 1mg/kg/day for 7days, respectively). 5-Fluorouracil was given orally (50mg/kg/day for 5days). Compared with normally-fed counterparts, PM-CP rats exhibited higher glutathione S-transferase, aminopeptidase N and cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase (CCBL) and lower gamma-glutamyltransferase activities, PM-FU rats exhibited decreased dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 1A1/2 activities and PM-MMC rats showed higher quinone reductase and depleted xanthine oxidase activities. Protein-malnourished drug-treated groups exhibited exacerbated gastrotoxicity, relative to normally-fed counterparts, manifested by lower mucus levels, higher permeability and histopathological deterioration, along with increased oxidative stress in PM-CP rats and exaggerated prostaglandin E2 production in PM-MMC rats. Conclusively, protein malnutrition alters CP, FU and MMC metabolism in rat stomach by enhancing CCBL pathway for CP activation, delaying FU elimination and activating two-electron reduction of MMC, potentiating their gastrotoxicity.

23454527|t|Effect of serum on diesel exhaust particles (DEP)-induced apoptosis of airway epithelial cells in vitro.
23454527|a|Patients with chronic airway diseases may be more susceptible to adverse effects of air pollutants including diesel exhaust particles (DEP). We investigated effects of foetal calf serum (FCS) on DEP-induced changes in airway epithelial cell apoptosis and inflammation. DEP (50-200 μg/ml) increased A549 cell viability in the absence of FCS. In the presence of 3.3%FCS, DEP (50-400 μg/ml) decreased A549 cell viability. N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 33 mM) and the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125, 33 μM) further decreased the viability in the presence of DEP (200 μg/ml) and 3.3% FCS. Under serum-free (SF) condition, DEP (50 μg/ml) reduced apoptotic cells; however, when 3.3% FCS added to the culture medium, this effect was abolished. DEP (200 μg/ml) induced mRNA expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) both in absence or presence of 3.3% FCS and enhanced JNK2 mRNA expression only in the presence of 3.3% FCS. Under SF condition, DEP (50 μg/ml) induced mRNA expression for p27 and p53, whereas cyclin E mRNA expression was inhibited by DEP (50 and 200 μg/ml). Furthermore, DEP (200 μg/ml) decreased the release of interleukin (IL)-8 in the absence of FCS. In conclusion, FCS modulates effects of DEP on cell death, cell cycle and apoptosis regulating proteins, and IL-8 release by activating oxidant stress pathways, JNK and NF-κB. Extravasation of serum, as occurs in the inflamed airways of patients with chronic airway diseases such as asthma and COPD, may render airway epithelial cells more susceptible to the deleterious effects of DEP.

23455312|t|Cerebrovascular Dilation via Selective Targeting of the Cholane Steroid-Recognition Site in the BK Channel β1-Subunit by a Novel Nonsteroidal Agent.
23455312|a|The Ca(2+)/voltage-gated K(+) large conductance (BK) channel β1 subunit is particularly abundant in vascular smooth muscle. By determining their phenotype, BK β1 allows the BK channels to reduce myogenic tone, facilitating vasodilation. The endogenous steroid lithocholic acid (LCA) dilates cerebral arteries via BK channel activation, which requires recognition by a BK β1 site that includes Thr169. Whether exogenous nonsteroidal agents can access this site to selectively activate β1-containing BK channels and evoke vasodilation remain unknown. We performed a chemical structure database similarity search using LCA as a template, along with a two-step reaction to generate sodium 3-hydroxyolean-12-en-30-oate (HENA). HENA activated the BK (cbv1 + β1) channels cloned from rat cerebral artery myocytes with a potency (EC50 = 53 μM) similar to and an efficacy (×2.5 potentiation) significantly greater than that of LCA. This HENA action was replicated on native channels in rat cerebral artery myocytes. HENA failed to activate the channels made of cbv1 + β2, β3, β4, or β1T169A, indicating that this drug selectively targets β1-containing BK channels via the BK β1 steroid-sensing site. HENA (3-45 μM) dilated the rat and C57BL/6 mouse pressurized cerebral arteries. Consistent with the electrophysiologic results, this effect was larger than that of LCA. HENA failed to dilate the arteries from the KCNMB1 knockout mouse, underscoring BK β1's role in HENA action. Finally, carotid artery-infusion of HENA (45 μM) dilated the pial cerebral arterioles via selective BK-channel targeting. In conclusion, we have identified for the first time a nonsteroidal agent that selectively activates β1-containing BK channels by targeting the steroid-sensing site in BK β1, rendering vasodilation.

23455597|t|Assessment of the abuse liability of ABT-288, a novel histamine H3 receptor antagonist.
23455597|a|RATIONALE: Histamine H3 receptor antagonists, such as ABT-288, have been shown to possess cognitive-enhancing and wakefulness-promoting effects. On the surface, this might suggest that H3 antagonists possess psychomotor stimulant-like effects and, as such, may have the potential for abuse. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to further characterize whether ABT-288 possesses stimulant-like properties and whether its pharmacology gives rise to abuse liability. METHODS: The locomotor-stimulant effects of ABT-288 were measured in mice and rats, and potential development of sensitization was addressed. Drug discrimination was used to assess amphetamine-like stimulus properties, and drug self-administration was used to evaluate reinforcing effects of ABT-288. The potential development of physical dependence was also studied. RESULTS: ABT-288 lacked locomotor-stimulant effects in both rats and mice. Repeated administration of ABT-288 did not result in cross-sensitization to the stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in mice, suggesting that there is little overlap in circuitries upon which the two drugs interact for motor activity. ABT-288 did not produce amphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination studies nor was it self-administered by rats trained to self-administer cocaine. There were no signs of physical dependence upon termination of repeated administration of ABT-288 for 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The sum of these preclinical data, the first of their kind applied to H3 antagonists, indicates that ABT-288 is unlikely to possess a high potential for abuse in the human population and suggests that H3 antagonists, as a class, are similar in this regard.

23456038|t|Unraveling a phosphorylation event in a folded protein by NMR spectroscopy: phosphorylation of the Pin1 WW domain by PKA.
23456038|a|The Pin1 protein plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the hyperphosphorylated neuronal Tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and is by itself regulated by phosphorylation. We have used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to both identify the PKA phosphorylation site in the Pin1 WW domain and investigate the functional consequences of this phosphorylation. Detection and identification of phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in a globular protein, while mostly occurring in solvent-exposed flexible loops, does not lead to chemical shift changes as obvious as in disordered proteins and hence does not necessarily shift the resonances outside the spectrum of the folded protein. Other complications were encountered to characterize the extent of the phosphorylation, as part of the (1)H,(15)N amide resonances around the phosphorylation site are specifically broadened in the unphosphorylated state. Despite these obstacles, NMR spectroscopy was an efficient tool to confirm phosphorylation on S16 of the WW domain and to quantify the level of phosphorylation. Based on this analytical characterization, we show that WW phosphorylation on S16 abolishes its binding capacity to a phosphorylated Tau peptide. A reduced conformational heterogeneity and flexibility of the phospho-binding loop upon S16 phosphorylation could account for part of the decreased affinity for its phosphorylated partner. Additionally, a structural model of the phospho-WW obtained by molecular dynamics simulation and energy minimization suggests that the phosphate moiety of phospho-S16 could compete with the phospho-substrate.

23461378|t|Dissecting the relative contribution of OATP1B1-mediated uptake of xenobiotics into human hepatocytes using siRNA.
23461378|a|Abstract 1. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 plays a pivotal role in the disposition of many anionic drugs. Significant overlap in substrate specificity between individual OATP isoforms has hampered the identification of the relative importance of individual isoforms for hepatic uptake of xenobiotics. 2. The present study focused on the use of siRNA technology to decrease OATP1B1 selectively in human hepatocytes. Following delivery of siRNA by the novel lipid, AtuFECT01, mRNA expression of OATP1B1 was reduced by 94%-98% with no significant toxicity. Off-target effects were also shown to be minimal as evidenced by the expression of common drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, nuclear receptors and associated co-regulators. Uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (5 nM) by OATP1B1 was reduced by 82%-95%. This methodology was subsequently used to assess the relative contribution of OATP1B1 uptake in human hepatocytes for olmesartan (42%-62%), valsartan (28%-81%), rosuvastatin (64%-72%), pitavastatin (84%-98%) and lopinavir (64%-89%). These data are consistent with previous values obtained using a relative activity factor approach. 3. The siRNA approach provides a robust and reproducible method for assessing the relative contribution of OATP1B1 to hepatic uptake of new chemical entities. The technique also has potential utility in facilitating detailed characterization of drug-drug interactions involving hepatic drug transporters.

23461841|t|Serum free fatty acid levels in PCOS patients treated with glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone.
23461841|a|Abstract To assess the effect of glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone in altering free fatty acids (FFAs), 36 PCOS women were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 14) was treated with 500 mg glucophage po bid, group 2 (n = 10) was treated with 400 mg magnesium oxide po bid and group 3 (n = 12) was treated with 50 mg spironolactone po bid for 12 weeks. A glucose tolerance test with 75 g glucose load was performed before and after treatment, collecting blood at 0, 1 and 2 h for insulin, glucose, FFA and aldosterone. Amount of FFA before and after treatment were compared by repeated measure ANOVA and represented as area under the curve. FFA levels before treatment were 0.83 ± 0.23, 0.77 ± 0.15 and 0.85 ± 0.28 and after treatment were 0.77 ± 0.48, 0.71 ± 0.18 and 0.66 ± 0.25 for glucophage, magnesium oxide and spironolactone-treated patients, respectively. The FFA levels were unchanged in the groups treated with glucophage and magnesium oxide but were significantly (p < 0.03) decreased in the group treated with spironolactone. Since FFAs are known to be involved in the development of insulin resistance, these results suggest that spironolactone may be useful for lowering insulin resistance in PCOS patients.

23466460|t|Membranar effects exerted in vitro by polyphenols - quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin - on HUVEC and Jurkat cells, relevant for diabetes mellitus.
23466460|a|Polyphenols are largely studied for their beneficial action in various pathologies, but the correlation with their effects on cell membranes is still elusive. In the present study we assessed the effects exerted in vitro by quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and curcumin on membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and Jurkat T lymphoblasts, in experimental conditions mimicking diabetes mellitus, i.e. high glucose conditions or increased concentration of advanced glycation end products. Results showed that the investigated polyphenols had beneficial effects on cell membranes altered in diabetic conditions, by restoring transmembrane potential and by membrane "stiffening". Moreover, they limited the release of pro-inflammatory factors, like monocyte chemotactic protein-1. These effects were more obvious for cells exposed to advanced glycation end products specific for the late stages of diabetes. Apparently, the inhibitory action of polyphenols on lipid peroxidation was associated with a decrease of membrane fluidity. Concluding, our in vitro study highlighted the potential beneficial action of polyphenols mainly in the late stages of diabetes, exerted at the level of membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential, accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect on endothelial and immune cells.

23466488|t|Oral l-glutamine increases active GLP-1 (7-36) amide secretion and improves glycemic control in stretpozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats.
23466488|a|l-glutamine is a non-essential amino acid. It decreased blood sugar, stimulated insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate l-glutamine increases glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (7-36) amide secretion in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NTM) induced diabetic Sprague Dawley rats. Molecular docking study was performed to elucidate the molecular basis for GLP-1 receptor agonistic activity. Type 2 diabetes was induced in overnight fasted Sprague Dawley rats pre-treated with nicotinamide (100mg/kg, i.p.) followed by 20min after administration of streptozotocin (55mg/kg, i.p.). The rats were divided into; I - nondiabetic, II - diabetic control, III - sitagliptin (5mg/kg, p.o.), IV -l-glutamine (250mg/kg, p.o.), V -l-glutamine (500mg/kg, p.o.) and VI -l-glutamine (1000mg/kg, p.o.). The l-glutamine and sitagliptin treatment was 8week. Plasma glucose was estimated every week. Body weight, food and water intake were recorded daily. Glycosylated haemoglobin, lipid profile, plasma and colonic active (GLP-1) (7-36) amide, mRNA expression of proglucagon GLP-1, plasma and pancreatic insulin, histology of pancreata and biomarkers of oxidative stress (superoxidase dismutase, reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S transferase) were measured after 8week. In acute study, the rats were divided into I - glucose (2.5g/kg, p.o.), II - sitagliptin (5mg/kg, p.o.), III -l-glutamine (250mg/kg, p.o.), IV -l-glutamine (500mg/kg, p.o.) and V -l-glutamine (1000mg/kg, p.o.). Plasma glucose, active GLP-1 (7-36) amide concentration and insulin levels were measured after glucose loading. The docking data indicated that l-glutamine bind to the GLP-1 receptor. l-glutamine decreased plasma glucose, increased plasma and pancreatic insulin, increased plasma and colonic active GLP-1 (7-36) amide secretion as well as decreased oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats.

23466526|t|ZEB2 zinc-finger missense mutations lead to hypomorphic alleles and a mild Mowat-Wilson syndrome.
23466526|a|Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID)-distinctive facial gestalt-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, commonly associating microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.

23470280|t|Corticotropin releasing factor and catecholamines enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala.
23470280|a|Glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays an important role in many behaviors including anxiety, memory consolidation and cardiovascular responses. While these behaviors can be modulated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and catecholamine signaling, the mechanism(s) by which these signals modify CeA glutamatergic neurotransmission remains unclear. Utilizing whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from neurons in the lateral subdivision of the CeA (CeAL), we show that CRF, dopamine (DA) and the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) all enhance the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) without altering sEPSC kinetics, suggesting they increase presynaptic glutamate release. The effect of CRF on sEPSCs was mediated by a combination of CRFR1 and CRFR2 receptors. While previous work from our lab suggests that CRFRs mediate the effect of catecholamines on excitatory transmission in other subregions of the extended amygdala, blockade of CRFRs in the CeAL failed to significantly alter effects of DA and ISO on glutamatergic transmission. These findings suggest that catecholamine and CRF enhancement of glutamatergic transmission onto CeAL neurons occurs via distinct mechanisms. While CRF increased spontaneous glutamate release in the CeAL, CRF caused no significant changes to optogenetically evoked glutamate release in this region. The dissociable effects of CRF on different types of glutamatergic neurotransmission suggest that CRF may specifically regulate spontaneous excitatory transmission.

23470776|t|Environmental stress, oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphism, and mental health following collective stress.
23470776|a|We examined whether the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs53576 genotype buffers the combined impact of negative social environments (e.g., interpersonal conflict/constraint) and economic stress on post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and impaired daily functioning following collective stress (September 11th terrorist attacks). Saliva was collected by mail and used to genotype 704 respondents. Participants completed Web-based assessments of pre-9/11 mental health, acute stress 9-23days after 9/11, the quality of social environments 1year post-9/11, economic stress 18months post-9/11, and PTS symptoms and impaired functioning 2 and 3years post-9/11. Interactions between negative social environments and economic stress were examined separately based on OXTR rs53576 genotype (GG vs. any A allele). For individuals with an A allele, a negative social environment significantly increased PTS symptoms without regard to the level of economic stress experienced. However, for respondents with a GG genotype, negative social environments predicted elevated PTS symptoms only for those also experiencing high economic stress. Gender moderated associations between negative social environments, economic stress, and impaired functioning. The functioning of females was most affected by negative social environments regardless of genotype and economic stress, whereas the functioning of males was differentially susceptible to economic stress depending on OXTR genotype and negative social environments. These findings suggest that it is important to consider the combined impact of gender and ongoing stress in different domains as moderators of genetic vulnerability following collective stress.

23473037|t|Identification of a SIRT1 mutation in a family with type 1 diabetes.
23473037|a|Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune-mediated β cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency. The histone deacetylase SIRT1 plays an essential role in modulating several age-related diseases. Here we describe a family carrying a mutation in the SIRT1 gene, in which all five affected members developed an autoimmune disorder: four developed type 1 diabetes, and one developed ulcerative colitis. Initially, a 26-year-old man was diagnosed with the typical features of type 1 diabetes, including lean body mass, autoantibodies, T cell reactivity to β cell antigens, and a rapid dependence on insulin. Direct and exome sequencing identified the presence of a T-to-C exchange in exon 1 of SIRT1, corresponding to a leucine-to-proline mutation at residue 107. Expression of SIRT1-L107P in insulin-producing cells resulted in overproduction of nitric oxide, cytokines, and chemokines. These observations identify a role for SIRT1 in human autoimmunity and unveil a monogenic form of type 1 diabetes.

23473679|t|Melanoma targeting property of a Lu-177-labeled lactam bridge-cyclized alpha-MSH peptide.
23473679|a|The purpose of this study was to determine the melanoma targeting property of (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice. (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex exhibited high receptor-mediated melanoma uptake and fast urinary clearance. The tumor uptake of (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex was 20.25 ± 4.59 and 21.63 ± 6.27% ID/g at 0.5 and 2h post-injection, respectively. Approximately 83% of injected dose cleared out the body via urinary system at 2h post-injection. (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex showed high tumor to normal organ uptake ratios except for the kidneys. The tumor/kidney uptake ratios of (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex were 2.76 and 1.74 at 2 and 24h post-injection. The melanoma lesions were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT using (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex as an imaging probe at 2h post-injection. Overall, high melanoma uptake coupled with fast urinary clearance of (177)Lu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex underscored its potential for melanoma treatment in the future.

23473801|t|Hinokitiol inhibits platelet activation ex vivo and thrombus formation in vivo.
23473801|a|Hinokitiol is a tropolone-related bioactive compound that has been used in hair tonics, cosmetics, and food as an antimicrobial agent. Recently, hinokitiol has attracted considerable interest because of its anticancer activities. Platelet activation plays a crucial role in atherothrombotic processes. We examined the effects of hinokitiol treatment on platelet activation using human platelets. In the present study, hinokitiol (1 and 2μM) inhibited the collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets, but did not inhibit the activation of platelets by other agonists, including thrombin, arachidonic acid, and ADP. Hinokitiol inhibited the phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)γ2, protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and Akt in collagen-activated human platelets, and significantly reduced intracellular calcium mobilization and hydroxyl radical (OH) formation. Hinokitiol also reduced the PKC activation and platelet aggregation stimulated by PDBu. In addition, hinokitiol significantly prolonged thrombogenesis in mice. Hinokitiol did not influence the binding of a fluorescent triflavin probe to the αIIbβ3 integrin on platelet membrane, and neither ODQ nor SQ22536 significantly reversed the hinokitiol-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. In conclusion, hinokitiol may inhibit platelet activation by inhibiting the PLCγ2-PKC cascade and hydroxyl radical formation, followed by suppressing the activation of MAPKs and Akt. Our study suggests that hinokitiol may represent a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.

23474014|t|Time-dependent effects of corticosterone on reward-based decision-making in a rodent model of the Iowa Gambling Task.
23474014|a|Corticosteroid hormones, released after stress, are known to change neuronal activity in two time-domains: within minutes via non-genomic pathways and with a delay of >1 h through pathways involving transcriptional regulation. Recent evidence in rodents and humans indicates that these two modes of corticosteroid action differently affect cognitive tasks. Here, we investigated whether reward-based decision-making, in a rat model of the Iowa Gambling Task (rIGT), is also differently altered by rapid versus delayed actions of corticosterone. We targeted the rapid and delayed time domain by injecting corticosterone (CORT, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) at 30 min (rapid) or 180 min (delayed) respectively prior to behavioural testing, during the final 3 days of the behavioural paradigm. In saline treated rats, the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm decreased over trial blocks, whilst this was attenuated when CORT was administered 30 min before testing. This attenuation was associated with a significantly increased c-Fos expression in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and insular cortex, and a trend for an increase in the infralimbic cortex. The rapid corticosteroid effect contrasted with treatment 180 min before testing, where the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm as well as c-Fos labelling was not affected. These findings indicate that rapid corticosteroid actions impair reward-based decision-making.

23477419|t|Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Characterization of Novel Endomorphin-1 Analogues as Extremely Potent μ-Opioid Agonists.
23477419|a|Recently we reported the synthesis and structure-activity study of endomorphin-1 (EM-1) analogues containing novel, unnatural α-methylene-β-aminopropanoic acids (Map). In the present study, we describe new EM-1 analogues containing Dmt(1), (R/S)-βPro(2), and (ph)Map(4)/(2-furyl)Map(4). All of the analogues showed a high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and increased stability in mouse brain homogenates. Of the new compounds, Dmt(1)-(R)-βPro(2)-Trp(3)-(2-furyl)Map(4) (analogue 12) displayed the highest affinity toward MOR, in the picomolar range (Ki(μ) = 3.72 pM). Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation assays indicated that this analogue displayed an extremely high agonistic potency, in the subpicomolar range (EC50 = 0.0421 pM, Emax = 99.5%). This compound also displayed stronger in vivo antinociceptive activity after iv administration when compared to morphine in the tail-flick test, which indicates that this analogue was able to cross the blood-brain barrier.

23478260|t|Age-Related Macular Degeneration-Associated Silent Polymorphisms in HtrA1 Impair Its Ability To Antagonize Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1.
23478260|a|Synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a transcript's coding region produce no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein product and are therefore intuitively assumed to have a neutral effect on protein function. We report that two common variants of high-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) that increase the inherited risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NvAMD) harbor synonymous SNPs within exon 1 of HTRA1 that convert common codons for Ala34 and Gly36 to less frequently used codons. The frequent-to-rare codon conversion reduced the mRNA translation rate and appeared to compromise HtrA1's conformation and function. The protein product generated from the SNP-containing cDNA displayed enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis and a reduced affinity for an anti-HtrA1 antibody. The NvAMD-associated synonymous polymorphisms lie within HtrA1's putative insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding domain. They reduced HtrA1's abilities to associate with IGF-1 and to ameliorate IGF-1-stimulated signaling events and cellular responses. These observations highlight the relevance of synonymous codon usage to protein function and implicate homeostatic protein quality control mechanisms that may go awry in NvAMD.

23485402|t|Therapeutic effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A: Potent blockade of autonomic transmission by targeted cleavage of only the pertinent SNAP-25.
23485402|a|In search of a basis for the impressive potency of an endoprotease that cleaves SNAP-25, botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), in treating numerous diseases due to hyper-active autonomic nerves, truncation of its target and inhibition of neurotransmission were studied in rat sympathetic neurons. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous cholinergic neurotransmission was blocked >80% by 1 pM BoNT/A despite cleaving <20% of the SNAP-25. A maximum cleavage of ∼60% SNAP-25 could be achieved with >1 nM BoNT/A, despite an absence of non-cleavable SNAP-25 in the detergent-solubilised neurons. In contrast, BoNT/E (100 nM) truncated nearly all the SNAP-25 in the intact cells, but was unable to block neurotransmission at low concentrations like BoNT/A. Chimeras created by inserting the acceptor-binding HC domain of BoNT/A into BoNT/E still cleaved all the SNAP-25, indicating ubiquitous expression of BoNT/A acceptors. Accordingly, SV2 and SNAP-25 were found to be co-expressed and broadly co-localised in neurons, but absent from non-neuronal cells. On the other hand, partial cleavage by the BoNT/A protease persisted upon replacing its HC with counterparts from BoNT/E or BoNT/B. Moreover, limited cleavage of SNAP-25 was conferred onto the protease from BoNT/E when fused to the N-terminus of BoNT/A. Thus, the BoNT/A protease is uniquely well-adapted for selectively inactivating the SNAP-25 directly involved in neurotransmission; this together with the toxin's acceptor and its target being localised on the peri-somatic boutons likely contribute to its exceptional therapeutic utility in the clinic.

23493372|t|Dexamethasone-mediated changes in adipose triacylglycerol metabolism are exaggerated, not diminished, in the absence of a functional GR dimerization domain.
23493372|a|The glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) has multiple effector mechanisms, including dimerization-mediated transactivation of target genes via DNA binding and transcriptional repression mediated by protein-protein interactions. Much attention has been focused on developing selective GR modulators that would dissociate adverse effects from therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects. The GR(dim/dim) mouse has a mutation in the dimerization domain of GR and has been shown to have attenuated transactivation with intact repression. To understand the role of GR dimerization-dependent targets in multiple tissues, we measured metabolic fluxes through several disease-relevant GC target pathways using heavy water labeling and mass spectrometry in wild-type and GR(dim/dim) mice administered the potent GC dexamethasone (DEX). Absolute triglyceride synthesis was increased in both wild-type and GR(dim/dim) mice by DEX in the inguinal and epididymal fat depots. GR(dim/dim) mice showed an exaggerated response to DEX in both depots. De novo lipogenesis was also greatly increased in both depots in response to DEX in GR(dim/dim), but not wild-type mice. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of DEX on bone and skin collagen synthesis rates was greater in wild-type compared with GR(dim/dim) mice. Wild-type mice were more sensitive to DEX-dependent decreases in insulin sensitivity than GR(dim/dim) mice. Wild-type and GR(dim/dim) mice were equally sensitive to DEX-dependent decreases in muscle protein synthesis. Chronic elevation of GCs in GR(dim/dim) mice results in severe runting and lethality. In conclusion, some metabolic effects of GC treatment are exaggerated in adipose tissue of GR(dim/dim) mice, suggesting that selective GR modulators based on dissociating GR transactivation from repression should be evaluated carefully.

23493568|t|X-box binding protein 1 is essential for insulin regulation of pancreatic alpha cell function.
23493568|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients often exhibit hyperglucagonemia despite hyperglycemia suggesting defective α-cell function. While endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to underlie β-cell dysfunction in T2D, its role in α-cell biology remains unclear. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its deficiency in β-cells has been reported to impair insulin secretion leading to glucose intolerance. To evaluate the role of XBP1 in α-cells, we created complementary in vivo (α-cell specific XBP1 knockout (αXBPKO) mice) and in vitro (stable XBP1 knock down α-cell line, αXBPKD) models. αXBPKO mice exhibited glucose intolerance, mild insulin resistance and an inability to suppress glucagon secretion following glucose stimulation. αXBPKD cells exhibited activation of IRE1, an upstream activator of XBP1, leading to phosphorylation of JNK. Interestingly, insulin treatment of αXBPKD cells reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (pY(896)), and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing serine phosphorylation (pS(307)) of IRS-1. Consequently the αXBPKD cells exhibited blunted suppression of glucagon secretion following insulin treatment in the presence of high glucose. Together, these data indicate that XBP1 deficiency in pancreatic α-cells induces altered insulin signaling and dysfunctional glucagon secretion.

23494106|t|Toxicological profiles of selected synthetic cannabinoids showing high binding affinities to the cannabinoid receptor subtype CB1.
23494106|a|Products containing synthetic cannabinoids are consumed as a surrogate for marihuana due to their non-detectability with commonly used drug tests and their strong cannabimimetic effects. Because data concerning their toxicological properties are scarce, the cytotoxic, genotoxic, immunomodulatory, and hormonal activities of four naphthoylindole compounds (JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-122 and JWH-210) and of one benzoylindole (AM-694) were studied in human cell lines and primary cells; tetrahydrocannabinol was included as the classical non-endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand. All compounds induced damage to the cell membranes of buccal (TR146) and breast (MCF-7) derived cells at concentrations of ≥75-100 μM. No cytotoxic responses were seen in other assays which reflect mitochondrial damage, protein synthesis, and lysosomal activities. JWH-073 and JWH-122 induced DNA migration in buccal and liver cells (HepG2) in single cell gel electrophoresis assays, while JWH-210 was only in the latter cell line active. No estrogenic activities were detected in bone marrow cells (U2-OS), but all compounds caused anti-estrogenic effects at levels between 2.1 and 23.0 μM. Furthermore, no impact on cytokine release (i.e., on IL-10, IL-6, IL-12/23p40 and TNFα levels) was seen in LPS-stimulated human PBMCs, except with JWH-210 and JWH-122 which caused a decrease of TNFα and IL-12/23p40. All toxic effects were observed with concentrations higher than those expected in body fluids of users. Since genotoxic effects are in general linear over a wide concentration range and the exposure levels may be higher in epithelial cells or in serum, further experimental work is required to find out if DNA damage takes place in drug users.

23494802|t|Curcuminoids Modulate Pro-Oxidant-Antioxidant Balance but not the Immune Response to Heat Shock Protein 27 and Oxidized LDL in Obese Individuals.
23494802|a|Curcuminoids have potentially important functional qualities including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial, the effects of a curcuminoid supplement on serum pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and antibody titres to Hsp27 (anti-Hsp27) and oxLDL (anti-oxLDL) were investigated. Thirty obese individuals were randomized to receive either curcuminoids (1 g/day) or placebo for a period of 30 days. After a wash-out period of 2 weeks, subjects were crossed over to the alternate regimen for another 30 days. Serum PAB along with anti-Hsp27 and anti-oxLDL titres was measured at the beginning and at the end of each study period. There was no significant carry-over effect for any of the assessed parameters. Curcuminoid supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in PAB (p = 0.044). However, no significant change was observed in serum concentrations of anti-Hsp27 or anti-oxLDL (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that oral curcuminoids supplementation (1g/day) is effective in reducing oxidative stress burden, though this needs to be validated in larger study populations.

23494944|t|Influence of the Green Tea Leaf Extract on Neurotoxicity of Aluminium Chloride in Rats.
23494944|a|Aluminium may have an important role in the aetiology/pathogenesis/precipitation of Alzheimer's disease. Because green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) reportedly has health-promoting effects in the central nervous system, we evaluated the effects of green tea leaf extract (GTLE) on aluminium chloride (AlCl3 ) neurotoxicity in rats. All solutions were injected into the cornu ammonis region 1 hippocampal region. We measured the performance of active avoidance (AA) tasks, various enzyme activities and total glutathione content (TGC) in the forebrain cortex (FbC), striatum, basal forebrain (BFb), hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum. AlCl3 markedly reduced AA performance and activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in all regions. It decreased TGC in the FbC, striatum, BFb, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum, and increased superoxide dismutase activity in the FbC, cerebellum and BFb. GTLE pretreatment completely reversed the damaging effects of AlCl3 on AA and superoxide dismutase activity, markedly corrected COX and AChE activities, and moderately improved TGC. GTLE alone increased COX and AChE activities in almost all regions. GTLE reduces AlCl3 neurotoxicity probably via antioxidative effects and improves mitochondrial and cholinergic synaptic functions through the actions of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin, compounds most abundantly found in GTLE. Our results suggest that green tea might be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

23495999|t|From synaptic spines to nuclear signaling: nuclear and synaptic actions of the amyloid precursor protein.
23495999|a|Despite intensive studies of the secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD), no new therapeutic agents have reached the clinics based on reducing Aβ levels through the use of secretase inhibitors or immunotherapy. Furthermore, the normal neuronal functions of APP and its various metabolites still remain under-investigated and unclear. Here, we highlight emerging areas of APP function that may provide new insights into synaptic development, cognition, and gene regulation. By modulating expression levels of endogenous APP in primary cortical neurons, the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations is modified, implying a key role for APP in maintaining neuronal calcium homeostasis essential for synaptic transmission. Disruption of this homeostatic mechanism predisposes to aging and AD. Synaptic spine loss is a feature of neurogeneration resulting in learning and memory deficits, and emerging evidence indicates a role for APP, probably mediated via one or more of its metabolites, in spine structure and functions. The intracellular domain of APP (AICD) has also emerged as a key epigenetic regulator of gene expression controlling a diverse range of genes, including APP itself, the amyloid-degrading enzyme neprilysin, and aquaporin-1. A fuller understanding of the physiological and pathological actions of APP and its metabolic network could provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in AD.

23497878|t|The influence of Goishi tea on adipocytokines in obese mice.
23497878|a|This study investigated the influence of Goishi-tea on visceral fat weight in induced obese mice. Mice were divided into two main groups, normal and obesity. In obesity group, mice were fed with high-fat diet. Goishi-tea including its fractions (ethyl-acetate layer and water layer) was administrated in normal and obesity three sub-groups. Results showed no influence of Goishi-tea in normal group. However, visceral fat weight, size of adipose cell and cholesterol level were significantly decreased in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group. Moreover, adiponectin levels tended to increase and adipocytokines has significant values lower in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group. Interestingly, Goishi tea involved in the high-fat diet induced-obese mice can inhibit fat accumulation and maintain adiponectins without increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. It would be beneficial for the prevention of metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disorder.

23499825|t|Steroidal glycosides from the bulbs of Fritillaria meleagris and their cytotoxic activities.
23499825|a|Steroidal glycosides (1-18), including 10 new compounds (1-10), were isolated from the bulbs of Fritillaria meleagris (Liliaceae). The structures of the new compounds were determined by two-dimensional (2D) NMR analysis, and by hydrolytic cleavage followed by spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis. The isolated compounds and their aglycones were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Morphological observation and flow cytometry analysis showed that 5β-spirostanol glycoside (2) and a cholestane derivative (17a) induced apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells through different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the (22R)-spirosolanol glycoside (11) selectively induced apoptosis in A549 cells without affecting the caspase-3 activity level.

23500058|t|Gene silencing of TNF-alpha in a murine model of acute colitis using a modified cyclodextrin delivery system.
23500058|a|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF-α) plays a pivotal role in mediating this inflammatory response. RNA interference (RNAi) holds great promise for the specific and selective silencing of aberrantly expressed genes, such as TNF-α in IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an amphiphilic cationic cyclodextrin (CD) vector for effective TNF-α siRNA delivery to macrophage cells and to mice with induced acute-colitis. The stability of CD.siRNA was examined by gel electrophoresis in biorelevant media reflecting colonic fluids. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with CD.TNF-α siRNA, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-α and IL-6 responses were measured by PCR and ELISA. Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) and treated by intrarectal administration with either CD.siRNA TNF-α or a control solution. In vitro, siRNA in CD nanocomplexes remained intact and stable in both fed and fasted simulated colonic fluids. RAW264.7 cells transfected with CD.TNF-α siRNA and stimulated with LPS displayed a significant reduction in both gene and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6. CD.TNF-α siRNA-treated mice revealed a mild amelioration in clinical signs of colitis, but significant reductions in total colon weight and colonic mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 compared to DSS-control mice were detected. This data indicates the clinical potential of a local CD-based TNF-α siRNA delivery system for the treatment of IBD.

23500387|t|Curcumin attenuates allergic airway inflammation by regulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs)/Th17 balance in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.
23500387|a|The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of curcumin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Asthma mice model was established by ovalbumin. A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2mg/kg), and curcumin (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg). Airway resistance (Raw) was measured by the forced oscillation technique, differential cell count in BAL fluid (BALF) was measured by Wright-Giemsa staining, histological assessment was measured by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, BALF levels of Treg/Th17 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Treg cells and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). Our study demonstrated that curcumin inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-17A level were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased IL-10 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that curcumin substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue. Flow cytometry (FCM) studies demonstrated that curcumin remarkably inhibited Th17 cells and significantly increased Treg cells. The results in vivo show ovalbumin-induced significantly broke Treg/Th17 balance; curcumin treatments markedly attenuated the inflammatory in asthma model by regulating Treg/Th17 balance. Our findings support the possible use of curcumin as a therapeutic drug for patients with allergic asthma.

23500491|t|Structural Basis for the ATP-Induced Isomerization of Kinesin.
23500491|a|Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. Previous studies have revealed that the ATP binding step is crucial both for the power stroke to produce motility and for the inter-domain regulation of ATPase activity to guarantee the processive movement of dimeric KIFs. Here, we report the first crystal structure of KIF4 complexed with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP (adenylyl imidodiphosphate), at 1.7Å resolution. By combining our structure with previously solved KIF1A structures complexed with two ATP analogs, molecular snapshots during ATP binding reveal that the closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket during ATP binding is achieved by closure of the backdoor. Closure of the backdoor stabilizes two mobile regions, switch I and switch II, to generate the phosphate tube from which hydrolyzed phosphate is released. Through the stabilization of switch II, the local conformational change at the catalytic center is further relayed to the neck-linker element that fully docks to the catalytic core to produce the power stroke. Because the neck linker is a sole element that connects the partner heads in dimeric KIFs, this tight structural coordination between the catalytic center and neck linker enables inter-domain communication between the partner heads. This study also revealed the putative microtubule-binding site of KIF4, thus providing structural insights that describe the specific binding of KIF4 to the microtubule.

23500550|t|Current perspectives on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) as bone anabolic therapies.
23500550|a|Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density and/or poor bone microarchitecture leading to an increased risk of fractures. The skeletal alterations in osteoporosis are a consequence of a relative deficit of bone formation compared to bone resorption. Osteoporosis therapies have mostly relied on antiresorptive drugs. An alternative therapeutic approach for osteoporosis is currently available, based on the intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Bone anabolism caused by PTH therapy is mainly accounted for by the ability of PTH to increase osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast survival. PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP)-an abundant local factor in bone- interact with the common PTH type 1 receptor with similar affinities in osteoblasts. Studies mainly in osteoporosis rodent models and limited data in postmenopausal women suggest that N-terminal PTHrP peptides might be considered a promising bone anabolic therapy. In addition, putative osteogenic actions of PTHrP might be ascribed not only to its N-terminal domain but also to its PTH-unrelated C-terminal region. In this review, we discuss the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anabolic actions of PTH and the similar potential of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) to increase bone mass and improve bone regeneration.

23504356|t|Pharmacotherapy for the core symptoms in autistic disorder: current status of the research.
23504356|a|The current review covers extant literature on pharmacotherapy for core symptoms of autism. The core symptoms of autism include impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. There are no known efficacious treatments for the core social symptoms, although effects on repetitive behaviors are indicated with some data. While studies of fenfluramine, secretin, opiates, and mood stabilizers generally find no effect, mixed results suggest more research is needed on antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. Newer lines of research, including cholinergic and glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, will be of considerable interest in the future. However, research on the treatment of core symptoms is plagued by limitations in study design, statistical power, and other issues inherent to the study of treatments for autism (e.g., heterogeneity of the disorder) that continue to prevent the elucidation of efficacious treatments.

23510370|t|Ectopic Thyroid Tissue in the Adrenal Gland: Report of 2 Cases with Pathogenetic Implications.
23510370|a|Background: Ectopic thyroid tissue is usually found anywhere along the embryonic descent pathway of the medial thyroid anlage from the tongue to the trachea (Wölfler area). However, ectopic thyroid tissue in the adrenal gland (ETTAG) is not easy to understand on the basis of thyroid embryology; because it is so rare, the possibility of metastasis should first be considered. Here, we describe 2 cases of ETTAG with pathogenetic implications and review the literature. Patient findings: Two cases of ETTAG presented as incidental cystic adrenal masses in adult females, one having a congenital hernia of Morgagni. The ETTAG was histologically indistinguishable from normal orthotopic thyroid tissue, and its follicular nature was confirmed by immunohistochemical positivity for thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1/Titf-1/Nkx2.1), cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK 7, pendrin, human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and FOXE1 (TTF-2), as well as positivity for the messenger RNA of the thyroglobulin gene by in situ hybridization analysis. No C cells (negativity for calcitonin, cromogranin and synaptophysin) were present. Neither BRAF nor KRAS mutations were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Further work-up did not show evidence of thyroid malignancy. Summary: ETTAG is a rare finding, with only 7 cases reported; women are much more frequently affected than men (8:1) and it usually clinically presents in the fifth decade (mean age: 54, range: 38-67) as a cystic adrenal mass incidentally discovered on abdominal ultrasonography and/or in computed tomography images. ETTAG is composed of normal follicular cells without C cells. The expression of some transcription factors (TTF-1, PAX8 and FOXE1) involved in development and/or migration of the medial thyroid anlage is preserved. Coexistence of a congenital hernia of Morgagni in one patient suggests an over-descent of medial thyroid anlage derived cells in its pathogenesis. Conclusion: Although ETTAG pathogenesis remains unknown, the lack of C cells together with the coexistence of a congenital defect of the anterior diaphragm (hernia of Morgagni) in one of our patients could suggest an over-descent of medial thyroid anlagen derived cells in the origin of this heterotopia.

23511016|t|Synthesis of a DOTA (Gd(3+))-conjugate of proton-pump inhibitor pantoprazole for gastric wall imaging studies.
23511016|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) structure and functions in humans. Despite filling the viscus lumen with a contrast agent, visualization of the viscus wall is limited. To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug. It is anticipated that by defining the wall of the stomach and colon, this compound will facilitate functional MRI of the GI tract in humans.

23511125|t|Acetylcholinesterase inhibition reveals endogenous nicotinic modulation of glutamate inputs to CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons in hippocampal slices.
23511125|a|The involvement of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the neurotoxicological effects of soman, a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and a chemical warfare agent, is not clear. This is partly due to a poor understanding of the role of AChE in brain nAChR-mediated functions. To test the hypothesis that AChE inhibition builds sufficient acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain and facilitates nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission, we used whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record spontaneous glutamate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons (SRI) in hippocampal slices. First, the frequency, amplitude and kinetics of EPSCs recorded from slices of control guinea pigs were compared to those recorded from slices of guinea pigs after a single injection of the irreversible AChE inhibitor soman (25.2μg/kg, s.c.). Second, EPSCs were recorded from rat hippocampal slices before and after their superfusion with the reversible AChE inhibitor donepezil (100nM). The frequency of EPSCs was significantly higher in slices taken from guinea pigs 24h but not 7 days after the soman injection than in slices from control animals. In 52% of the rat hippocampal slices tested, bath application of donepezil increased the frequency of EPSCs. Further, exposure to donepezil increased both burst-like and large-amplitude EPSCs, and increased the proportion of short (20-100ms) inter-event intervals. Donepezil's effects were suppressed significantly in presence of 10μM mecamylamine or 10nM methyllycaconitine. These results support the concept that AChE inhibition is able to recruit nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission in the hippocampus and such a mechanism can contribute to the acute neurotoxicological actions of soman.

23511711|t|A Nanogram Dose of the CYP3A Probe Substrate Midazolam to Evaluate Drug Interactions.
23511711|a|The objective of the study was to establish an in vivo method for assessing cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity using therapeutically inert nanogram doses of midazolam. We administered four escalating single doses of oral midazolam (0.0001-3 mg) to 12 healthy participants, stratified according to CYP3A5 carrier status, to assess pharmacokinetics linearity. We then evaluated the interactions with the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg q.d.) after nanogram and regular doses of midazolam. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) were linear over the entire range of doses. Ketoconazole reduced midazolam oral clearance by 92.8%. AUC and Cmax increased by 1,540 and 363%, respectively. CYP3A5 carrier status had no influence on midazolam oral clearance or its inhibition by ketoconazole. This is the first study showing that midazolam pharmacokinetics is linear in a 30,000-fold concentration range, and therefore that nano- and microgram doses of midazolam can reliably predict the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in therapeutic doses and can be used to assess CYP3A activity even in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors.Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2013); advance online publication 20 March 2013. doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.27.

23512501|t|NAD(P)H : Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 Inducer Activity of Some Saudi Arabian Medicinal Plants.
23512501|a|Medicinal plants are a rich source of biologically-active phytochemicals and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Specific phytochemicals and extracts of their plant sources have the ability to reduce the risk for chronic degenerative diseases by induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, many of which also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. One such multifunctional cytoprotective enzyme is NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase. In this study, we prepared extracts of 27 Saudi Arabian medicinal plants which belong to 18 different plant families and tested their ability to induce NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase in murine hepatoma cells grown in microtiter plate wells. In addition to the Brassicaceae, a known source of NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase inducer activity, we found substantial inducer activity in extracts from the Apiaceae, Apocynaceae, and the Asteraceae families. Five out of a total of eight active extracts are from plants which belong to the Asteraceae family. We further show that artemisinin, an agent which is used clinically for the treatment of malaria, contributes but does not fully account for the inducer activity of the extract of Artemisia monosperma. In contrast to artemisinin, deoxyartemisinin is inactive in this assay, demonstrating the critical role of the endoperoxide moiety of artemisinin for inducer activity. Thus, the NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase inducer activity of extracts of some Saudi Arabian medicinal plants indicates the presence of specific phytochemicals which have the potential to protect against chronic degenerative diseases.

23512537|t|Metabolism of Beclomethasone Dipropionate by Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes.
23512537|a|Inhaled glucocorticoids, such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), are the mainstay treatment of asthma. However, ∼30% of patients exhibit little to no benefit from treatment. It has been postulated that glucocorticoid resistance, or insensitivity, is attributable to individual differences in glucocorticoid receptor-mediated processes. It is possible that variations in cytochrome P450 3A enzyme-mediated metabolism of BDP may contribute to this phenomenon. This hypothesis was explored by evaluating the contributions of CYP3A4, 3A5, 3A7, and esterase enzymes in the metabolism of BDP in vitro and relating metabolism to changes in CYP3A enzyme mRNA expression via the glucocorticoid receptor in lung and liver cells. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolized BDP via hydroxylation ([M4] and [M6]) and dehydrogenation ([M5]) at similar rates; CYP3A7 did not metabolize BDP. A new metabolite [M6], formed by the combined action of esterases and CYP3A4 hydroxylation, was also characterized. To validate the results observed using microsomes and recombinant enzymes, studies were also conducted using A549 lung and DPX2 liver cells. Both liver and lung cells produced esterase-dependent metabolites [M1-M3], with [M1] correlating with CYP3A5 mRNA induction in A549 cells. Liver cells produced both hydroxylated and dehydrogenated metabolites [M4, M5, and M6], but lung cells produced only the dehydrogenated metabolite [M5]. These studies show that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolize BDP to inactive metabolites and suggest that differences in the expression or function of these enzymes in the lung and/or liver could influence BDP disposition in humans.

23512754|t|Effect of the Potent Antiviral 1-Cinnamoyl-3,11-Dihydroxymeliacarpin on Cytokine Production by Murine Macrophages Stimulated with HSV-2.
23512754|a|The limonoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) isolated from leaf extracts of Melia azedarach L, has potent antiherpetic effect in epithelial cells. Since Meliacine, the partially purified extract source of CDM, has therapeutic effect on murine genital herpes, the potential use of CDM as microbicide against herpetic infections was studied here. To determine the cytotoxic effect of CDM, the MTT assay and acridine orange staining of living cells were performed. The antiherpetic action of CDM was measured by plaque reduction assay, and the immunomodulatory effect was determined by measuring the cytokine production using a bioassay and ELISA method. The results presented here showed that CDM inhibited Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) multiplication in Vero cells but did not affect its replication in macrophages which were not permissive to HSV infection. In macrophages, levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, NO, IL-6 and IL-10 were increased by CDM used alone or in combination with HSV-2. Besides, CDM not only synergized TNF-α production combined with IFN-γ, but also prolonged its expression in time. Results indicate that CDM inhibits HSV-2 multiplication in epithelial cells and also increases cytokine production in macrophages, both important actions to the clearance of infecting virus in the mouse vagina.

23517558|t|Intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction of the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor AMG 221 in rats with chronic vascular catheters.
23517558|a|Abstract 1. A catheterized rat model was used to define the intestinal and hepatic components of oral bioavailability for an 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, AMG 221. These data were integrated with standard in vivo metabolism studies to elucidate the components contributing to the oral disposition of a novel drug candidate. 2. Intestinal and hepatic extraction ratios of AMG 221 obtained using a five-catheter rat model were 0.56 and 0.32, respectively. Therefore, both intestinal and hepatic extraction contributed to the first-pass component of oral bioavailability. There was no evidence for significant gut extraction of systemically administered drug. 3. Mass balance data and in vivo metabolite characterization obtained after administration of [(14)C] AMG 221 to rat showed that AMG 221 was completely absorbed from the gut lumen following an oral dose, primarily excreted in urine and was almost completely metabolized prior to excretion. 4. Hepatic bioavailability (FH), measured in two animals at various time points after oral dose administration was somewhat variable but generally characterized by an initial reduction during the absorption phase followed by an increase during the elimination phase, consistent with hepatic distribution of AMG 221. 5. The five-catheter rat model afforded estimates of hepatic and intestinal contribution to oral bioavailability that were used with other data to define the preclinical ADME characteristics of a drug candidate.

23517733|t|Synthesis and selected immunological properties of substituted quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines.
23517733|a|A new type of azaphenothiazines - tetracyclic quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines, possessing common substituents (H, CH3, Cl, Br, F, CF3, SCH3) in positions 8-10 and pharmacophoric aminoalkyl substituents in position 6, were obtained from diquinodithiin and 2,2'-dichloro-3,3'-diquinolinyl disulfide in several-step syntheses. Sixty one compounds, grouped as the 6H, 6-dialkylaminoalkyl, 6-acylaminoalkyl and sulfonylaminoalkyl derivatives, were tested for cytotoxicity, their effects on phytohemagglutin A (PHA)-induced proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by these cells. The compounds exhibited differential inhibitory activities in these tests and significantly varied in terms of cytotoxicity. The most promising compounds were tested for growth inhibition of leukemia L-1210 cells, colon cancer SV-948 cells and epidermal carcinoma A-341 cells. The most active compounds exhibited anticancer activity against these cell lines comparable to that of cisplatin. The structure-activity relationship of the compounds were discussed.

23519149|t|Predictive factors of sensitivity to elisidepsin, a novel kahalalide f-derived marine compound.
23519149|a|Elisidepsin (PM02734, Irvalec®) is a synthetic marine-derived cyclic peptide of the Kahalalide F family currently in phase II clinical development. Elisidepsin was shown to induce rapid oncosis in ErbB3-expressing cells. Other predictive factors of elisidepsin sensitivity remained unknown. A panel of 23 cancer cell lines of different origin was assessed for elisidepsin cytotoxicity and correlated with mutational state, mRNA and protein expression of selected genes. Elisidepsin showed potent and broad cytotoxic effects in our cancer cell line panel, being active at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 2 μM that may be relevant for clinical settings. We have shown that elisidepsin is more active in cells harboring epithelial phenotype with high E-cadherin and low vimentin expression. In addition, high ErbB3 and Muc1 expression was correlated with sensitivity to elisidepsin, whereas the presence of KRAS activating mutations was associated with resistance. In DU-PM cells with acquired resistance to elisidepsin, ErbB3 expression was decreased, while Bcl2 was increased. DU-PM cells displayed higher sensitivity to ErbB1-inhibitors suggesting possible cross-talk of ErbB1 and ErbB3 signaling pathways. Combinations of elisidepsin with lapatinib and several chemotherapies including 5-FU and oxaliplatin resulted in synergistic effects that offer the potential of clinical use of elisidepsin in combination settings.

23521495|t|Controlled Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles through Antibody Recognition: Study and Utilizing the Effect of Particle Size on Interparticle Distance.
23521495|a|An assembly of gold nanoparticle through the recognition of unmodified antibody was developed. The use of peptide (Cys-Ala-Leu-Asn-Asn) as ligands to stabilize and functionalize gold nanoparticles provides technical and operational convenience. These peptide-capped particles in different sizes are recognized by antibody and assembly to form dimers and expanded hybrid material by controlling the conditions. The interparticle spacing of these assemblies was well studied with small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, and it was found that the interparticle spacing is inversely dependent on the particle size. This relationship of interparticle spacing and particle size is closely related to the structure of antibody linker. Therefore, analyzing the interparticle spacing of assemblies can reveal the equilibrium configuration of IgG. Based on the investigation, the Fab-Fab angle of IgG is obtained to be ≈102° and the Fab arms are ≈7.8 nm. These results provide new experimental data on the structure of flexible IgG.

23523780|t|Differential responses to ω-agatoxin IVA in murine frontal cortex and spinal cord derived neuronal networks.
23523780|a|ω-Agatoxin-IVA is a well known P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and has been shown to affect presynaptic Ca(2+) currents as well postsynaptic potentials. P/Q-type voltage gated Ca(2+) channels play a vital role in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and thus play a role in action potential generation. Monitoring spontaneous activity of neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) provides an important tool for examining this neurotoxin. Changes in extracellular action potentials are readily observed and are dependent on synaptic function. Given the efficacy of murine frontal cortex and spinal cord networks to detect neuroactive substances, we investigated the effects of ω-agatoxin on spontaneous action potential firing within these networks. We found that networks derived from spinal cord are more sensitive to the toxin than those from frontal cortex; a concentration of only 10nM produced statistically significant effects on activity from spinal cord networks whereas 50nM was required to alter activity in frontal cortex networks. Furthermore, the effects of the toxin on frontal cortex are more complex as unit specific responses were observed. These manifested as either a decrease or increase in action potential firing rate which could be statistically separated as unique clusters. Administration of bicuculline, a GABAA inhibitor, isolated a single response to ω-agatoxin, which was characterized by a reduction in network activity. These data support the notion that the two clusters detected with ω-agatoxin exposure represent differential responses from excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations.

23523781|t|Pharmacokinetic, neurochemical, stereological and neuropathological studies on the potential effects of paraquat in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum of male C57BL/6J mice.
23523781|a|The pharmacokinetics and neurotoxicity of paraquat dichloride (PQ) were assessed following once weekly administration to C57BL/6J male mice by intraperitoneal injection for 1, 2 or 3 weeks at doses of 10, 15 or 25mg/kg/week. Approximately 0.3% of the administered dose was taken up by the brain and was slowly eliminated, with a half-life of approximately 3 weeks. PQ did not alter the concentration of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), or increase dopamine turnover in the striatum. There was inconsistent stereological evidence of a loss of DA neurons, as identified by chromogenic or fluorescent-tagged antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There was no evidence that PQ induced neuronal degeneration in the SNpc or degenerating neuronal processes in the striatum, as indicated by the absence of uptake of silver stain or reduced immunolabeling of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) neurons. There was no evidence of apoptotic cell death, which was evaluated using TUNEL or caspase 3 assays. Microglia (IBA-1 immunoreactivity) and astrocytes (GFAP immunoreactivity) were not activated in PQ-treated mice 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96 or 168h after 1, 2 or 3 doses of PQ. In contrast, mice dosed with the positive control substance, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 10mg/kg/dose×4 doses, 2h apart), displayed significantly reduced DA and DOPAC concentrations and increased DA turnover in the striatum 7 days after dosing. The number of TH(+) neurons in the SNpc was reduced, and there were increased numbers of degenerating neurons and neuronal processes in the SNpc and striatum. MPTP-mediated cell death was not attributed to apoptosis. MPTP activated microglia and astrocytes within 4h of the last dose, reaching a peak within 48h. The microglial response ended by 96h in the SNpc, but the astrocytic response continued through 168h in the striatum. These results bring into question previous published stereological studies that report loss of TH(+) neurons in the SNpc of PQ-treated mice. This study also suggests that even if the reduction in TH(+) neurons reported by others occurs in PQ-treated mice, this apparent phenotypic change is unaccompanied by neuronal cell death or by modification of dopamine levels in the striatum.

23524567|t|FGFR4 genetic polymorphisms determine the chemotherapy response of Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
23524567|a|Aim:To investigate the relationship of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) gene polymorphisms with the response of Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to chemotherapy.Methods:A total of 629 patients with Stage III (A+B) or IV NSCLC, as well as 729 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. All the patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, and the therapeutic effects were evaluated. Three polymorphisms in the FGFR4 gene (rs351855G/A, rs145302848C/G, and rs147603016G/A) were genotyped, and the association between the 3 polymorphisms and the chemotherapy effect was analyzed using SPSS software, version 16.0.Results:The genotype frequencies of rs145302848C/G and rs147603016G/A were not significantly different between NSCLC patients and healthy controls on one hand, and between the responders and non-responders to the chemotherapy on the other hand. The distribution of AA genotype and A-allele of rs351855G/A was significantly lower in NSCLC patients than in healthy controls. Using patients with the GG genotype as a reference, the AA carrier had a significantly reduced risk for the development of NSCLC after normalizing to age, sex and smoking habits. In NSCLC patients, this genotype occurred more frequently in the responders to the chemotherapy than in non-responders. The chance of being a responder was significantly increased with the AA genotype as compared to G genotype. The AA genotype of rs351855G/A had a better prognosis compared with GA and GG genotype carriers: the overall survival of patients with the AA genotype of rs351855G/A was significantly longer than those with the GG+GA genotype (21.1 vs 16.5 months).Conclusion:The rs351855G/A polymorphisms of FGFR4 gene can be used to predict the occurrence, chemotherapy response and prognosis of NSCLC.

23525167|t|NMR characterisation of dynamics in solvates and desolvates of formoterol fumarate.
23525167|a|Solid-state NMR is used to characterise dynamics in the ethanol solvate of the pharmaceutical material formoterol fumarate and its associated desolvate. Jump rates and activation barriers for dynamic processes such as phenyl ring rotation and methyl group rotational diffusion are derived from 1D-EXSY and (13)C spin-lattice relaxation times respectively. (2)H and (13)C spin-lattice relaxation times measured under magic-angle spinning conditions are used to show that the fumarate ion in the desolvate is undergoing small-amplitude motion on a frequency scale of 100s of MHz at ambient temperature with an activation parameter of about 32 kJ mol(-1). Exact calculations of relaxation times under MAS provide a simple and robust means to test motional models in cases where relaxation rate maxima are observed, including for systems where the crystal structure of the material is unknown.

23526814|t|tert-Butylcarbamate-Containing Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Apoptosis Induction, Cytodifferentiation, and Antiproliferative Activities in Cancer Cells.
23526814|a|Herein we report novel pyrrole- and benzene-based hydroxamates (8, 10) and 2'-aminoanilides (9, 11) bearing the tert-butylcarbamate group at the CAP moiety as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Compounds 8 b and 10 c selectively inhibited HDAC6 at the nanomolar level, whereas the other hydroxamates effected an increase in acetyl-α-tubulin levels in human acute myeloid leukemia U937 cells. In the same cell line, compounds 8 b and 10 c elicited 18.4 and 21.4 % apoptosis, respectively (SAHA: 16.9 %), and the pyrrole anilide 9 c displayed the highest cytodifferentiating effect (90.9 %). In tests against a wide range of various cancer cell lines to determine its antiproliferative effects, compound 10 c exhibited growth inhibition from sub-micromolar (neuroblastoma LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells) to low-micromolar (lung H1299 and A549, colon HCT116 and HT29 cancer cells) concentrations. In HT29 cells, 10 c increased histone H3 acetylation, and decreased the colony-forming potential of the cancer cells by up to 60 %.

23528299|t|Discovery of a synthetic Aminopeptidase N inhibitor LB-4b as a potential anticancer agent.
23528299|a|APN inhibitors have been considered as potential anticancer agents for years. LB-4b is the first synthetic APN inhibitor to be evaluated for both of its anti-invasion and anti-angiogenesis effects. As a potent synthetic APN inhibitor (IC50=850nM, versus bestatin of 8.1μM), LB-4b was determined to have more significant block effects to cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis than bestatin. Besides, it is able to be easily synthesized with a high total yield, while the reported synthetic methods of bestatin are much more complex.

23530959|t|Multipart Copolyelectrolyte Adhesive of the Sandcastle Worm, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes): Catechol Oxidase Catalyzed Curing through Peptidyl-DOPA.
23530959|a|Tube-building sabellariid polychaetes have major impacts on the geology and ecology of shorelines worldwide. Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual sabellariid worms build tubular shells by gluing together mineral particles with a multipart polyelectrolytic adhesive. Distinct sets of oppositely charged components are packaged and stored in concentrated granules in separate cell types. Homogeneous granules contain sulfated macromolecules as counter-polyanion to polycationic Pc2 and Pc5 proteins, which become major components of the fully cured glue. Heterogeneous granules contain polyphosphoproteins, Pc3A/B, paired with divalent cations and polycationic Pc1 and Pc4 proteins. Both types of granules contain catechol oxidase that catalyzes oxidative cross-linking of L-DOPA. Co-secretion of catechol oxidase guarantees rapid and spatially homogeneous curing with limited mixing of the preassembled adhesive packets. Catechol oxidase remains active long after the glue is fully cured, perhaps providing an active cue for conspecific larval settlement.

23535337|t|Disruption of AtWNK8 Enhances Tolerance of Arabidopsis to Salt and Osmotic Stresses via Modulating Proline Content and Activities of Catalase and Peroxidase.
23535337|a|With no lysine kinases (WNKs) play important roles in plant growth and development. However, its role in salt and osmotic stress tolerance is unclear. Here, we report that AtWNK8 is mainly expressed in primary root, hypocotyl, stamen and pistil and is induced by NaCl and sorbitol treatment. Compared to the wild-type, the T-DNA knock-out wnk8 mutant was more tolerant to severe salinity and osmotic stresses, as indicated by 27% and 198% more fresh weight in the NaCl and sorbitol treatment, respectively. The wnk8 mutant also accumulated 1.43-fold more proline than the wild-type in the sorbitol treatment. Under NaCl and sorbitol stresses, catalase (CAT) activity in wnk8 mutant was 1.92- and 3.7-times of that in Col-0, respectively. Similarly, under salt and osmotic stress conditions, peroxidase (POD) activities in wnk8 mutant were 1.81- and 1.58-times of that in Col-0, respectively. Taken together, we revealed that maintaining higher CAT and POD activities might be one of the reasons that the disruption of AtWNK8 enhances the tolerance to salt stress, and accumulating more proline and higher activities of CAT and POD might result in the higher tolerance of WNK8 to osmotic stress.

23536314|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Cilostazol on Retinal Ganglion Cell damage in Diabetic Rats.
23536314|a|Neurodegeneration is an important component of diabetic retinopathy with increasing evidence that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death occurs early in diabetes. We investigated the effects of cilostazol, which has been widely used to manage diabetic complications, on retinal ganglion cell death in diabetic retina. Four-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats as matched nondiabetic controls were treated with daily oral cilostazol at 30mg/kg or 0.9 % saline solution. In OLETF rats at the age of 40 weeks, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence staining was upregulated in vertical sections and showed a more ramified pattern in whole-mount retinas compared with that in LETO rats. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was limited to the ganglion cell layer in LETO rats, but extended into the outer plexiform layer in OLETF rats. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting demonstrated that cilostazol treatment reduced GFAP and VEGF expression in the retinas of OLETF rats. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNLEL) staining revealed an increase in the RGC layer in OLETF compared with LETO rats (P<0.05), and cilostazol treatment reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in OLETF rats (P<0.05). Relieving retinal ischemia by systemic cilostazol treatment had a noticeable protective effect on RGCs in diabetic rats. Cilostazol treatment may be useful for the management of diabetic retinal vascular dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.

23537661|t|Effects of lactational and/or in utero exposure to environmental contaminants on the glucocorticoid stress-response and DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor promoter in male rats.
23537661|a|Perinatal events can reprogram the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis for the entire lifespan leading to abnormal glucocorticoid stress-response (GSR) in adulthood: a phenomenon reported to be mediated by changes in DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene promoter. We examined whether in utero and/or lactational exposure to mixtures of environmental contaminants can also induce abnormal GSR during adulthood. The experiment included nine treatment groups. From gestation day (GD) 0 until postnatal day (PND) 20, dams were fed daily with a cookie laced with corn oil (control) or a chemical mixture (M) [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and methylmercury] at 0.5 or 1.0mg/kg/day (0.5M, and M). At birth, some control (C) and M litters were cross-fostered to create four groups with the following in utero/postnatal exposure: C/C, M/C, C/M, M/M. Other dams received 1.8ng/kg/day of a mixture of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (non-ortho PCBs, PC-dibenzodioxins and PC-dibenzofurans) without or with 0.5M (0.5MAhR). In adult male offspring the abundance of GR in treated groups was not different from the control, but the AhR and M groups were significantly different from each other with opposite effects in the hippocampus and liver. There was no change in DNA methylation of the GR promoter (exon-17 and -110). Abnormal GSRs were detected in the AhR, 0.5MAhR, CM, and MM groups. The literature associates abnormal GSR with metabolic and mental health impairments, thus these results support further investigation of the influence of developmental exposure to environmental contaminants and predisposition to stress-induced diseases.

23537702|t|Systematic evaluation of 640 FDA drugs for their effect on CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells using a novel cell-based high throughput screening assay.
23537702|a|Regulatory T cells (Treg), which play a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells, have great therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases and transplantation. However, progress on their clinical application has been hampered by the lack of high throughput screening (HTS) strategies for the systematic and rapid evaluation of existing drugs and the identification of novel drug candidates. In this report, we present an innovative in vitro HTS assay using CD4(+) T cells from Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice that specifically express the GFP signal in Foxp3(+) Treg cells detectable by FACS analysis in a high throughput manner. Systematic evaluation of 640 FDA-approved drugs revealed that 70 drugs increased the number of Treg cells with suppression function only in the presence of TGFβ, 75 drugs increased Treg numbers even in the absence of TGFβ, and 32 drugs increased Treg numbers synergistically with TGFβ. The identified Treg-promoting drugs include those previously known to induce Treg (rapamycin and retinoic acid), statins, glucocorticoids and drugs in many other categories. Furthermore, Treg cells cultured with the identified drugs possess surface and intracellular markers characteristic of natural Treg cells and possess suppressive function. These results suggest that this Treg HTS assay can be used to screen compound libraries to identify novel chemical entities for Treg-based immune therapies.

23538201|t|EZETIMIBE INCREASES HEPATIC IRON LEVELS IN MICE FED A HIGH-FAT DIET.
23538201|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that ezetimibe may be a promising agent for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH). Phlebotomy and dietary iron restriction reduces serum transaminase in NAFLD/NASH patients. Recent studies showed that mutual effects exist between lipid metabolism and iron metabolism. Accordingly, the effects of ezetimibe on iron metabolism were examined in mice fed a high-fat diet with or without iron. C57BL/6 mice were fed the following diets for 12 weeks. Experiment 1:1) a control diet; C 2) C plus ezetimibe (0.3mg/day; 4 weeks); CE 3) a high-fat diet; H 4) H plus ezetimibe; HE. Experiment 2: 1) C containing carbonyl iron (average; 22.4mg/day; 6 weeks); CI 2) CI plus ezetimibe; CIE 3) H containing carbonyl iron; HI 4) HI plus ezetimibe; HIE. Blood, livers, and duodenum were removed after 12 weeks. In Experiment 1, hepatic iron levels were higher in HE than H, whereas there was no difference between C and CE. Hepatic mRNA expression of transferrin receptor 1 and 2, ferritins, and hepcidin were increased more in CE than C, and in HE than H. In duodenum, DMT1, ferritinH, and hephaestin mRNA levels were increased in CE compared to C. In Experiment 2, hepatic iron concentrations were higher in HIE than HI. Hepatic mRNA expression of ferritinL and hepcidin were increased in HIE compared to HI. In duodenum, ferritinL mRNA was increased in HIE compared to CIE. Ezetimibe induced hepatic iron uptake transporter expression in mice fed a high-fat diet, causing increased hepatic iron concentrations.

23541399|t|Androgen deprivation from pre-puberty to peripuberty interferes in proteins expression in pubertal and adult rat epididymis.
23541399|a|Few studies have focused on experimental testosterone deprivation in immature animals. Therefore, this study used sexually immature rats aiming to evaluate the testes and epididymis histology and proteins expression in these organs on PND50 and 75, after premature antiandrogen exposure, from PND21 to 44. Although the androgen deprivation from pre-puberty up to peripuberty did not alter the histological organization of the testes and epididymis either at puberty or at adulthood, the treatment impaired the expression of specific proteins in epididymal tissue at puberty and adulthood (androgen receptor, calmodulin, Rab11A). These changes may be related to impaired epididymal function, sperm quality and fertility capacity as observed in a previous study. Further studies are necessary to better investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the impairment on reproductive competence of male rats after precocious hormonal injury.

23541670|t|Discovery of a series of novel 5H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine-2-phenyl ethers, as potent JAK3 kinase inhibitors.
23541670|a|We report the discovery of a novel series of ATP-competitive Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitors based on the 5H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine scaffold. The initial leads in this series, compounds 1a and 1h, showed promising potencies, but a lack of selectivity against other isoforms in the JAK family. Computational and crystallographic analysis suggested that the phenyl ether moiety possessed a favorable vector to achieve selectivity. Exploration of this vector resulted in the identification of 12b and 12d, as potent JAK3 inhibitors, demonstrating improved JAK family and kinase selectivity.

23542114|t|Arsenic trioxide depletes cancer stem-like cells and inhibits repopulation of neurosphere derived from glioblastoma by downregulation of Notch pathway.
23542114|a|Notch signaling has been demonstrated to have a central role in cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We have recently demonstrated the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on CSLCs in glioblastoma cell lines. In this study we used neurosphere recovery assay that measured neurosphere formation at three time points to assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after ATO treatment. Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. ATO inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and STAT3 through Notch signaling blockade. These data show that the ATO is a promising new approach to decrease glioblastoma proliferation and recurrence by downregulation of Notch pathway.

23545458|t|Total saponins of Panax notoginseng enhance VEGF and relative receptors signals and promote angiogenesis derived from rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.
23545458|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (tPNS), main constituents extracted from Panax Notoginseng, a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to increase protein expression and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The effects of tPNS on angiogenesis were studied in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: rBMSCs were stimulated by tPNS of 48h. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF-A, Flt-1 and Kdr in rBMSCs were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). rBMSCs were induced to differentiate into endothelial-like cells and the effects of tPNS on the angiogenesis ability of rBMSCs and rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation were assayed by a Matrigel model in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: tPNS (100μg/ml) significantly enhanced the mRNA expression level of VEGF-A and Kdr compared to the control group, while they had no obvious effect on the expression of Flt-1. tPNS (1μg/ml and 100μg/ml) significantly increased capillary network forming of rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation in Matrigel in vitro. tPNS (50μg/kg, 100μg/kg and 150μg/kg) also significantly increased angiogenesis induced by the combination with implantation of rBMSCs and Matrigel in vivo. CONCLUSION: tPNS up-regulate VEGF-A and Kdr expression, and promote angiogenesis in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

23546605|t|Ovarian Expression of Insulin-Like Peptide 3 (INSL3) and Its Receptor (RXFP2) During Development of Bovine Antral Follicles and Corpora Lutea and Measurement of Circulating INSL3 Levels During Synchronized Estrous Cycles.
23546605|a|Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), a major product of testicular Leydig cells, is also expressed by the ovary, but its functional role remains poorly understood. Here, we quantified expression of INSL3 and its receptor RXFP2 in theca interna cell (TIC) and granulosa cell compartments of developing bovine antral follicles and in corpora lutea (CL). INSL3 and RXFP2 mRNA levels were much higher in TIC than granulosa cell and increased progressively during follicle maturation with INSL3 peaking in large (11-18 mm) estrogen-active follicles and RXFP2 peaking in 9- to 10-mm follicles before declining in larger (11-18 mm) follicles. Expression of both INSL3 and RXFP2 in CL was much lower than in TIC. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed abundant expression of INSL3 mRNA and protein in TIC. These observations indicate follicular TIC rather than CL as the primary site of both INSL3 production and action, implying a predominantly autocrine/paracrine role in TIC. To corroborate the above findings, we showed that in vitro exposure of TIC to a luteinizing concentration of LH greatly attenuated expression of both INSL3 and its receptor while increasing progesterone secretion and expression of STAR and CYP11A1. Moreover, in vivo, a significant cyclic variation in plasma INSL3 was observed during synchronized estrous cycles. INSL3 and estradiol-17β followed a similar pattern, both increasing after luteolysis, before falling sharply after the LH surge. Thus, theca-derived INSL3, likely from the dominant preovulatory follicle, is detectable in peripheral blood of cattle, and expression is down-regulated during luteinization induced by the preovulatory LH surge. Collectively, these findings underscore the likely role of INSL3 as an important intrafollicular modulator of TIC function/steroidogenesis, while raising doubts about its potential contribution to CL function.

23547843|t|Cytotoxicity and Modulation of Cancer-Related Signaling by (Z)- and (E)-3,4,3',5'-Tetramethoxystilbene Isolated from Eugenia rigida.
23547843|a|Bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaves of Eugenia rigida yielded three stilbenes, (Z)-3,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (1), (E)-3,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (2), and (E)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (3). Their structures were determined using 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and HRESIMS. The sterically hindered Z-stereoisomer 1, a new natural product, was prepared by time-dependent photoisomerization of the E-isomer (2) under UV irradiation at λ254 nm, while 2,3,5,7-tetramethoxyphenanthrene (5) was identified at λ365 nm by UHPLC/APCI-MS and NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1-3 were tested against a panel of luciferase reporter gene assays that assess the activity of many cancer-related signaling pathways, and the Z-isomer (1) was found to be more potent than the E-isomer (2) in inhibiting the activation of Stat3, Smad3/4, myc, Ets, Notch, and Wnt signaling, with IC50 values between 40 and 80 μM. However, both compounds showed similar inhibition against Ap-1 and NF-κB signaling. In addition, 1 demonstrated cytotoxic activity toward human leukemia cells, solid tumor cells of epidermal, breast, and cervical carcinomas, and skin melanoma, with IC50 values between 3.6 and 4.3 μM, while 2 was weakly active against leukemia, cervical carcinoma, and skin melanoma cells. Interestingly, 2 showed antioxidant activity by inhibition of ROS generation to 50% at 33.3 μM in PMA-induced HL-60 cells, while 1 was inactive at 100 μM (vs Trolox 1.4 μM).

23556445|t|Genomic variation in the MAP3K5 gene is associated with β-thalassemia disease severity and hydroxyurea treatment efficacy.
23556445|a|Aim: In this study we explored the association between genetic variations in MAP3K5 and PDE7B genes, residing on chromosome 6q23, and disease severity in β-hemoglobinopathy patients, as well as the association between these variants with response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Materials & methods: For this purpose, we genotyped β-thalassemia intermedia and major patients and healthy controls, as well as a cohort of compound heterozygous sickle cell disease/β-thalassemia patients receiving HU as HbF augmentation treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high HbF and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Results: A short tandem repeat in the MAP3K5 promoter and two intronic MAP3K5 gene variants, as well as a PDE7B variant, are associated with low HbF levels and a severe disease phenotype. Moreover, MAP3K5 mRNA expression levels are altered in the context of high HbF and are affected by the presence of HU. Lastly, the abovementioned MAP3K5 variants are associated with HU treatment efficacy. Conclusion: Our data suggest that these MAP3K5 variants are indicative of β-thalassemia disease severity and response to HU treatment.

23558678|t|Annexin A2 regulates β1 integrin internalization and intestinal epithelial cell migration.
23558678|a|The gastrointestinal epithelium functions as an important barrier that separates luminal contents from the underlying tissue compartment and is vital in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Mucosal wounds in inflammatory disorders compromise the critical epithelial barrier. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) rapidly migrate to reseal wounds. We have previously observed that a membrane associated, Actin binding protein, Annexin A2 (AnxA2), is up-regulated in migrating IECs and plays an important role in promoting wound closure. To identify the mechanisms by which AnxA2 promotes IEC movement and wound closure we used a loss of function approach. AnxA2 specific shRNA was utilized to generate IECs with stable down-regulation of AnxA2. Loss of AnxA2 inhibited IEC migration while promoting enhanced cell-matrix adhesion. These functional effects were associated with increased levels of β1 integrin protein, which is reported to play an important role in mediating the cell-matrix adhesive properties of epithelial cells. Since cell migration requires dynamic turnover of integrin based adhesions, we tested if AnxA2 modulates internalization of cell surface β1 integrin required for forward cell movement. Indeed, pulse-chase biotinylation experiments in IECs lacking AnxA2 demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface β1 integrin that was accompanied by decreased β1 integrin internalization and degradation. These findings support an important role of AnxA2 in controlling dynamics of β1 integrin at the cell surface that in turn is required for the active turnover of cell-matrix associations, cell migration and wound closure.

23561166|t|Effects of fisetin supplementation on hepatic lipogenesis and glucose metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats fed on a high fat diet.
23561166|a|The modulatory effects of daily fisetin supplementation for 8weeks on genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia in rats fed a high fat (HF) diet were evaluated. Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPARγ, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fisetin supplementation decreases cardiovascular risks by ameliorating hepatic steatosis and lowering circulating glucose concentrations.

23562060|t|Discovery of ML326: The first sub-micromolar, selective M5 PAM.
23562060|a|This Letter describes the further chemical optimization of the M5 PAM MLPCN probes ML129 and ML172. A multi-dimensional iterative parallel synthesis effort quickly explored isatin replacements and a number of southern heterobiaryl variations with no improvement over ML129 and ML172. An HTS campaign identified several weak M5 PAMs (M5 EC50 >10μM) with a structurally related isatin core that possessed a southern phenethyl ether linkage. While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30μM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.

23562076|t|Improved Insulin Sensitivity despite Increased Visceral Adiposity in Mice Deficient for the Immune Cell Transcription Factor T-bet.
23562076|a|Low-grade inflammation in fat is associated with insulin resistance, although the mechanisms are unclear. We report that mice deficient in the immune cell transcription factor T-bet have lower energy expenditure and increased visceral fat compared with wild-type mice, yet paradoxically are more insulin sensitive. This striking phenotype, present in young T-bet(-/-) mice, persisted with high-fat diet and increasing host age and was associated with altered immune cell numbers and cytokine secretion specifically in visceral adipose tissue. However, the favorable metabolic phenotype observed in T-bet-deficient hosts was lost in T-bet(-/-) mice also lacking adaptive immunity (T-bet(-/-)xRag2(-/-)), demonstrating that T-bet expression in the adaptive rather than the innate immune system impacts host glucose homeostasis. Indeed, adoptive transfer of T-bet-deficient, but not wild-type, CD4(+) T cells to Rag2(-/-) mice improved insulin sensitivity. Our results reveal a role for T-bet in metabolic physiology and obesity-associated insulin resistance.

23567041|t|Evidence for a new mechanism behind HIFU-triggered release from liposomes.
23567041|a|A promising approach for local drug delivery is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-triggered release of drugs from stimuli-responsive nanoparticles such as liposomes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether another release mechanism is involved with HIFU-triggered release from liposomes beside cavitation and temperature. Furthermore, it was studied whether this new release mechanism allows the release of lipophilic compounds. Therefore, both a lipophilic (Nile red) and a hydrophilic (fluorescein) compound were loaded into thermosensitive (TSL) or non-thermosensitive liposomes (NTSL) and the liposomes were subjected both to continuous wave- (CW) and pulsed wave (PW)-HIFU. The mean liposome size varied from 97 to 139nm with a polydispersity index (PDI)≤0.06 for the different formulations. The Tm of the phospholipid bilayer of the TSL was around 42°C. Approximately 80% of fluorescein was released within 15min from TSL at temperatures≥42°C. In contrast, no fluorescein release from NTSL and NR release from both TSL and NTSL was observed at temperatures up to 60°C. CW-HIFU exposure of TSL resulted in rapid temperature elevation up to 52°C and subsequently almost quantitative fluorescein release. Fluorescein release from NTSL was also substantial (~64% after 16min at 20W). Surprisingly, CW-HIFU exposure (20W for 16min) resulted in the release of NR from TSL (~66% of the loaded amount), and this was even higher from NTSL (~78%). PW-HIFU exposure did not result in temperatures above the Tm of TSL. However, nearly 85% of fluorescein was released from TSL after 32min at 20W of PW-HIFU exposure, whereas the release from NTSL was around 27%. Interestingly, NR release from NTSL was~30% after 2min PW-HIFU exposure and increased to~70% after 32min. Furthermore, addition of microbubbles to the liposomes prior to PW-HIFU exposure did not result in more release, which suggests that cavitation can be excluded as the main mechanism responsible for the triggered release of both a hydrophilic and a lipophilic model compound from liposomes. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that the mean size and PDI of the liposomes did not significantly change after CW- and PW-HIFU exposure. Taken together, it is therefore concluded that neither temperature elevation nor inertial cavitation is essential for the release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from liposomes. It is assumed that the release originates from radiation force-induced acoustic streaming, causing the liposomes to collide at the walls of the exposure chamber leading to shear forces which in turn results in reversible liposome destabilization and release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds.

23567243|t|DICO, a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid, induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hepatoma cells.
23567243|a|DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have therapeutic potential against tumors.

23570998|t|Assessment of the role of flavonoids for inducing osteoblast differentiation in isolated mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells.
23570998|a|Quercetin and rutin are common flavonoids in fruit and vegetables, and have been reported to affect bone development. However, the effect of flavonoids on osteoblast differentiation remains a matter of controversy. In the present study, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were isolated and characterized for their use in osteoblast differentiation using two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin. BMMSCs were cultured in various concentrations of quercetin and rutin during the osteoblast differentiation period of 10 days. Both quercetin and rutin were found to up regulate the osteoblast differentiation in dose dependent manner, albeit to lesser extent in case of former than that of latter. Quercetin and rutin also increased alkaline phosphatase activity by about 150 and 240% and demonstrated mineralization up to 110 and 200% respectively as compared to control (which was considered as 100%). Further, both the flavonoids were also found to increase the expression of some of the prominent markers for differentiation of osteoblast like osteopontin, osterix, RunX2, osteoprotegerin and osteocalcin. The current data suggests that certain classes of flavonoids like rutin and quercetin can be used in the cure and management of osteodegenerative disorders due to their osteoblast specific differentiation activities.

23572520|t|S-nitrosation of glutathione transferase P1-1 is controlled by the conformation of a dynamic active-site helix.
23572520|a|S-nitrosation is a post-translational modification of protein cysteine residues which occurs in response to cellular oxidative stress. Although it is increasingly being linked to physiologically important processes, the molecular basis for protein regulation by this modification remains poorly understood. We used transient kinetic methods to determine a minimal mechanism for spontaneous GSNO-mediated transnitrosation of human glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1, a major detoxification enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation. C47 of GSTP1-1 is S-nitrosated in two steps, with the chemical step limited by a pre-equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of helix α2 at the active site. C101, in contrast, is S-nitrosated in a single step but is subject to negative cooperativity due to steric hindrance at the dimer interface. Despite the presence of a GSNO binding site at the active site of GSTP1-1, isothermal titration calorimetry as well as nitrosation experiments using CysNO demonstrate that GSNO binding does not precede S-nitrosation of GSTP1-1. Kinetics experiments using the cellular reductant GSH show that C101-NO is substantially more resistant to denitrosation than C47-NO, suggesting a potential role for C101-NO in long term nitric oxide storage or transfer. These results constitute the first report of the molecular mechanism of spontaneous protein transnitrosation, providing insight into the post-translational control of GSTP1-1 as well as the process of protein transnitrosation in general.

23578993|t|Effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an organosulfur compound from Allium plants, on experimentally induced hepatic prefibrogenic events in wistar rat.
23578993|a|Aim of present study was to investigate the effect of NAC on experimental chronic hepatotoxicity models induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and thioacetamide (TAA). CCl4 toxicity was induced by administering 200μl CCl4 (diluted 2:3 in coconut oil)/100g body weight, p.o., twice weekly for 8 weeks. TAA toxicity was induced by administering 150mg/kg b. wt. of TAA i.p., twice weekly for 8 weeks. NAC treatment was started along with toxicants (CCl4 and TAA) for 8 weeks and continued for further 4 weeks. Self reversal group was kept without any treatment for 4 weeks after completion of toxicant treatments. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Bilirubin were measured in serum. Hydroxyproline (HP), lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Glutathione (GSH) were determined in liver samples by colorimetric methods. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 450 2E1), activity was determined as hydroxylation of aniline in liver microsomes. General examination and histological analysis were also performed. Serum markers of liver damage (AST, ALT, ALP and Bilirubin) were increased by CCl4 and TAA intoxication (p<0.001), whereas co-treatment with NAC reversed such changes (p<0.001). HP was enhanced in toxicant groups (p<0.001 in CCl4 and TAA), but inhibited by NAC (p<0.001). LPO was increased while as GSH, CAT and GPx decreased by the administration of CCl4 and TAA (p<0.001); co-administration of NAC restored these liver markers to normal levels (p<0.001). Biochemical determinations were corroborated by general and histological findings. Keeping in view the biochemical and histopathological studies, it was concluded that CCl4 and TAA are strong hepatotoxic agents that produce liver fibrosis with close proximity to human etiology (micronodular cirrhosis) and NAC has a significant protective activity against CCl4 and TAA. NAC has also been validated as a model against oxidative burden in chronic liver pathology.

23583258|t|Phenolic compounds present in Sardinian wine extracts protect against the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxysterols in CaCo-2 human enterocyte-like cells.
23583258|a|Cholesterol auto-oxidation products, namely oxysterols, are widely present in cholesterol-rich foods. They are thought to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the human digestive tract, playing a role in intestinal mucosal damage. This report concerns the marked up-regulation in differentiated CaCo-2 colonic epithelial cells of two key inflammatory interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, caused by a mixture of oxysterols representative of a high cholesterol diet. This strong pro-inflammatory effect appeared to be dependent on the net imbalance of red-ox equilibrium with the production of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species through the colonic NADPH-oxidase NOX1 activation. Induction of NOX1 was markedly while not fully inhibited by CaCo-2 cell pre-incubation with phenolic extracts obtained from well-selected wines from typical grape varieties grown in Sardinia. Oxysterol-dependent NOX1 activation, as well as interleukin synthesis, were completely prevented by Cannonau red wine extract that contains an abundant phenolic fraction, in particular phenolic acids and flavonoids. Conversely, cell pre-treatment with Vermentino white wine extract with smaller phenolic fraction showed only a partial NOX1 down-regulation and was ineffective in interleukin synthesis induced by dietary oxysterols. It is thus likely that the effects of Sardinian wine extracts against intestinal inflammation induced by dietary oxysterols are mainly due to their high phenolic content: low doses of phenolics would be responsible only for direct scavenging oxysterol-dependent ROS production. Besides this direct activity, an excess of phenolic compounds detectable in red wine, may exert an additional indirect action by blocking oxysterol-related NOX1 induction, thus totally preventing the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory events triggered by dietary oxysterols.

23585555|a|OBJECTIVE: Low thyroid function may be associated with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated on the basis of creatinine metabolism. Thyroid hormone directly affects serum creatinine in muscle and low thyroid function might exert a similar direct effect in the kidney. The goal of the study was to evaluate this possibility by assessment of the inulin-based GFR and to examine the mechanism underlying the reduction of GFR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were assessed by simultaneous measurements of plasma clearance of para-aminohippurate (CPAH) and inulin (Cin) in 26 patients with serum creatinine <1.00 mg/dl and without thyroid disease. All subjects were normotensive with or without antihypertensive treatment and were kept in a sodium-replete state. Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were calculated using Gomez`s formulae. RESULTS: Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), including within the normal range (0.69-4.30 μIU/ml), was positively correlated with vascular resistance at the afferent arteriole (Ra) (r = 0.609, p = 0.0010), but not at the efferent arteriole (Re). Serum TSH was significantly and negatively correlated with renal plasma flow (RPF), renal blood flow (RBF), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (r = -0.456, p = 0.0192; r = -0.438, p = 0.0252; r = -0.505, p = 0.0086, respectively). In multiple regression analysis, serum TSH was significantly positively associated with Ra after adjustment for age and mean blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that low thyroid function, even within the normal range, is associated with reduced RPF, RBF and GFR, which might be caused by a preferential increase of Ra.

23588308|t|A Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling Approach to Predict Disease-Drug Interactions: Suppression of CYP3A by IL-6.
23588308|a|Elevated cytokine levels can down-regulate expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and suppress their activity. Treatment of inflammation or infection with cytokine-modulating therapeutic proteins (TP) could reverse suppression manifesting as therapeutic protein-drug drug interactions (TP-DDI). A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model was used to quantitatively predict the impact of IL-6 on sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. Elevated simvastatin AUC in virtual rheumatoid arthritis patients, following 100 pg/mL of IL-6 was comparable to observed clinical data (59% versus 58%). In virtual bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, 500 pg/ml of IL-6 resulted in increase in cyclosporine AUC that was in good agreement with the observed data (45% versus 39%). In a different group of BMT patients treated with cyclosporine, the magnitude of interaction with IL-6 was under predicted ~3-fold. The complexity of TP-DDI highlights underlying pathophysiological factors to be considered but these simulations provide valuable first steps towards predictions of TP-DDI risk.Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2013); accepted article preview online 10 April 2013 doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.79.

23588312|t|A DPYD Variant (Y186C) in Individuals of African Ancestry Is Associated With Reduced DPD Enzyme Activity.
23588312|a|5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is used to treat many aggressive cancers, such as those of the colon, breast, and head and neck. The responses to 5-FU, with respect to both toxicity and efficacy, vary among racial groups, potentially because of variability in the activity levels of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by the DPYD gene). In this study, the genetic associations between DPYD variations and circulating mononuclear-cell DPD enzyme activity were evaluated in 94 African-American and 81 European-American volunteers. The DPYD-Y186C variant was unique to individuals of African ancestry, and DPD activity was 46% lower in carriers as compared with noncarriers (279 ± 35 vs. 514 ± 168 pmol 5-FU min(-1) mg(-1); P = 0.00029). In this study, 26% of the African Americans with reduced DPD activity were carriers of Y186C. In the African-American cohort, after excluding Y186C carriers, homozygous carriers of C29R showed 27% higher DPD activity as compared with noncarriers (609 ± 152 and 480 ± 152 pmol 5-FU min(-1) mg(-1), respectively; P = 0.013).Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2013); advance online publication 1 May 2013. doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.69.

23589329|t|Arsenic inhibits autophagic flux activating the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in a p62-dependent manner.
23589329|a|The Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway is a protective mechanism promoting cell survival. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway by natural compounds has been proven to be an effective strategy for chemoprevention. Interestingly, a cancer-promoting function of Nrf2 has been recently observed in many types of tumors due to deregulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 axis, which leads to constitutive activation of Nrf2. Here, we report a novel mechanism of Nrf2 activation by arsenic that is distinct from that of chemopreventive compounds. Arsenic deregulates the autophagic pathway through blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and sequestration of p62, Keap1, and LC3. Thus, arsenic activates Nrf2 through a non-canonical mechanism (p62-dependent), leading to a chronic, sustained activation of Nrf2. In contrast, activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone depend upon Keap1-C151 and not p62 (the canonical mechanism). More importantly, SF and tBHQ do not have any effect on autophagy. In fact, SF and tBHQ alleviate arsenic-mediated deregulation of autophagy. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that arsenic causes prolonged activation of Nrf2 through autophagy dysfunction, possibly providing a similar scenario to constitutive activation of Nrf2 found in certain human cancers. This may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans.

23591044|t|Melatonin and ethanol intake exert opposite effects on circulating estradiol and progesterone and differentially regulate sex steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts, and uteri of adult rats.
23591044|a|Chronic ethanol intake is associated with sex hormone disturbances, and it is well known that melatonin plays a key role in regulating several reproductive processes. We report the effects of ethanol intake and melatonin treatment (at doses of 100μg/100gBW/day) on sex hormones and steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts and uteri of ethanol-preferring rats. After 150 days of treatment, animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were harvested to evaluate androgen, estrogen, progesterone and melatonin receptor subunits (AR, ER-α and ER-β, PRA, PRB and MT1R, respectively). Melatonin decreased estradiol (E2) and increased progesterone (P4) and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-STM), while an ethanol-melatonin combination reduced both P4 and E2. Ovarian AR was not influenced by either treatment, and oviduct AR was reduced after ethanol-melatonin combination. Oviduct ER-α, ER-β and uterine ER-β were down-regulated by either ethanol or melatonin. Conversely, ovarian PRA and PRB were positively regulated by ethanol and ethanol-melatonin combination, whereas PRA was down-regulated in the uterus and oviduct after ethanol consumption. MT1R was increased in ovaries and uteri of melatonin-treated rats. Ethanol and melatonin exert opposite effects on E2 and P4, and they differentially regulate the expression of sex steroid receptors in female reproductive tissues.

23597507|t|Phα1β toxin prevents capsaicin-induced nociceptive behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity without acting on TRPV1 channels.
23597507|a|Phα1β toxin is a peptide purified from the venom of the armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer, with markedly antinociceptive action in models of acute and persistent pain in rats. Similarly to ziconotide, its analgesic action is related to inhibition of high voltage activated calcium channels with more selectivity for N-type. In this study we evaluated the effect of Phα1β when injected peripherally or intrathecally in a rat model of spontaneous pain induced by capsaicin. We also investigated the effect of Phα1β on Ca(2+) transients in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and HEK293 cells expressing the TRPV1 receptor. Intraplantar or intrathecal administered Phα1β reduced both nocifensive behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin similarly to that observed with SB366791, a specific TRPV1 antagonist. Peripheral nifedipine and mibefradil did also decrease nociceptive behavior induced by intraplantar capsaicin. In contrast, ω-conotoxin MVIIA (a selective N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker) was effective only when administered intrathecally. Phα1β, MVIIA and SB366791 inhibited, with similar potency, the capsaicin-induced Ca(2+) transients in DRG neurons. The simultaneous administration of Phα1β and SB366791 inhibited the capsaicin-induced Ca(2+) transients that were additive suggesting that they act through different targets. Moreover, Phα1β did not inhibit capsaicin-activated currents in patch-clamp recordings of HEK293 cells that expressed TRPV1 receptors. Our results show that Phα1β may be effective as a therapeutic strategy for pain and this effect is not related to the inhibition of TRPV1 receptors.

23598363|t|Rescue of platinum-damaged oocytes from programmed cell death through inactivation of the p53 family signaling network.
23598363|a|Non-proliferating oocytes within avascular regions of the ovary are exquisitely susceptible to chemotherapy. Early menopause and sterility are unintended consequences of chemotherapy, and efforts to understand the oocyte apoptotic pathway may provide new targets for mitigating this outcome. Recently, the c-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) has become the focus of research as a fertoprotective drug against cisplatin. However, the mechanism by which imatinib protects oocytes is not fully understood, and reports of the drug's efficacy have been contradictory. Using in vitro culture and subrenal grafting of mouse ovaries, we demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of oocytes within primordial follicles. We found that, before apoptosis, cisplatin induces c-Abl and TAp73 expression in the oocyte. Oocytes undergoing apoptosis showed downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax. While imatinib was unable to block cisplatin-induced DNA damage and damage response, such as the upregulation of p53, imatinib inhibited the cisplatin-induced nuclear accumulation of c-Abl/TAp73 and the subsequent downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax, thereby abrogating oocyte cell death. Surprisingly, the conditional deletion of Trp63, but not ΔNp63, in oocytes inhibited apoptosis, as well as the accumulation of c-Abl and TAp73 caused by cisplatin. These data suggest that TAp63 is the master regulator of cisplatin-induced oocyte death. The expression kinetics of TAp63, c-Abl and TAp73 suggest that cisplatin activates TAp63-dependent expression of c-Abl and TAp73 and, in turn, the activation of TAp73 by c-Abl-induced BAX expression. Our findings indicate that imatinib protects oocytes from cisplatin-induced cell death by inhibiting c-Abl kinase, which would otherwise activate TAp73-BAX-mediated apoptosis. Thus, imatinib and other c-Abl kinase inhibitors provide an intriguing new way to halt cisplatin-induced oocyte death in early follicles and perhaps conserve the endocrine function of the ovary against chemotherapy.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 19 April 2013; doi:10.1038/cdd.2013.31.

23598904|t|Suppression of ZIP8 expression is a common feature of cadmium-resistant and manganese-resistant RBL-2H3 cells.
23598904|a|Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells show markedly high sensitivity to both CdCl2 and MnCl2 compared with other rat cell lines, due to efficient accumulation of cadmium and manganese. To clarify the roles of metal transporters in hyperaccumulation of cadmium and manganese in RBL-2H3 cells, Cd-resistant and Mn-resistant cells were developed from RBL-2H3 cells by continuous exposure to CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively. The established Cd-resistant (RBL-Cdr) and Mn-resistant (RBL-Mnr) cells exhibited about 20 times higher LC50 values of CdCl2 and MnCl2, respectively, than parental RBL-2H3 cells, and showed cross-resistance to each metal. The resistance to cadmium and manganese was primarily conferred by a marked decrease in the uptake of both metals. RBL-Cdr cells also showed cross-resistance to HgCl2 and AgNO3 probably due to enhanced expression of metallothionein. Among the possible transporters involved in the uptake of Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), the expression of ZIP8 (Zrt-, Irt-related protein 8), encoded by Slc39a8, showed a marked suppression in both RBL-Cdr and RBL-Mnr cells. These results suggest that ZIP8 plays a pivotal role in the transport and toxicity of Cd(2+) and Mn(2+) in RBL-2H3 cells.

23601700|t|In Vitro Reconstitution of Complexes between proMatrix Metalloproteinase-9 and the Proteoglycans Serglycin and Versican.
23601700|a|Previously we have shown that a fraction of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) synthesized by the macrophage cell line THP-1 was bound to a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) core protein as a reduction sensitive heteromer. It was also shown that the hemopexin-like (PEX) domain and the fibronectin-like (FnII) module in the enzyme are involved in the heteromer formation. In the present work we show that reduction sensitive and SDS-stable heteromers can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing proMMP-9 with either serglycin, versican or CSPGs isolated from various monocytic cell lines. In addition, a strong but SDS-soluble proMMP-9·CSPG heteromer was formed. The two macromolecules in the SDS-stable reduction sensitive heteromers were not linked together by disulphide bonds. As for the heteromer isolated from THP-1 cells, the in vitro reconstituted SDS-stable and SDS-soluble heteromers had a weaker binding to gelatin than the proMMP-9 monomer. Furthermore, gelatin inhibited the in vitro reconstitution of the heteromers, showing that the FnII module is involved in the complex formation. TIMP-1 could not be detected in the formed proMMP-9·CSPG complexes. However, the presence of TIMP-1 inhibited the formation of the SDS-soluble heteromer, but not the SDS-stable reduction sensitive heteromer. This indicates that different regions in the PEX domain are involved the formation of these heteromers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Productive SAR also transferred to the benzotriazepine and spirobenzodiazepine scaffolds, providing a solution to the labile stereocenter at the C3 position. The molecular basis of how compound 27 inhibits mature CA assembly is rationalized using high-resolution structural information. Our understanding of how compound 27 may inhibit immature Gag assembly is also discussed.

23602986|t|Neuroactive effects of cotinine on the hippocampus: Behavioral and biochemical parameters.
23602986|a|The present work evaluated the effects of nicotine (NIC), cotinine (COT), mecamylamine (MEC), methyllycaconitine (MLA) and dihydro-beta-eritroidine (DHβE) on memory extinction and the following biochemical parameters of the hippocampus: lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity (AC) and the phosphorylation of Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK 1/2). Young male rats that were implanted bilaterally with cannulae were submitted to memory extinction tests sessions, and their hippocampi were dissected for biochemical assays. The extinction of fear memory was significantly improved by both nicotine and its metabolite. Cotinine significantly increased LPO, while nicotine significantly decreased it. Antioxidant capacity was increased by all treatments. Our results showed that cotinine, unlike nicotine, may increase oxidative stress in the hippocampus, but this increase depends upon the dose used and happens without causing corresponding impairments in cognitive function. Cotinine also increased the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in a similar fashion as nicotine. Considering these results, it is plausible to wonder to what extent nicotine-attributed effects are really due to the actions of this alkaloid and whether they could be due instead to cotinine or to cotinine-nicotine interactions within the brain.

23603059|t|Arsenic upregulates the expression of angiotensin II Type I receptor in mouse aortic endothelial cells.
23603059|a|Although chronic arsenic exposure is a well-known risk for cardiovascular disease and has a strong correlation with hypertension, the molecular pathogenesis underlying arsenic exposure-induced hypertension remains poorly understood. To delineate the pathogenesis, we examined changes in the mRNA levels of 2 angiotensin II Type I receptor (AT1R) subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR, in a mouse aortic endothelial cell line, END-D. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant increases in the mRNA levels of 2 AT1R subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR following sodium arsenite (SA) treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SA increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that SA enhances the phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). These phosphorylations were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant. Finally, SA-induced AT1R expression was found to be prevented both by NAC and specific JNK inhibitor, SP6001325, strongly indicating that AT1R upregulation is a result of the ROS-mediated activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that arsenic indeed upregulates the AT1R expression, thus highlighting a role of arsenic-induced aberrant AT1R signaling in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

23603382|t|Protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage and oxidative stress related gene expression in rat liver under chronic poisoning of arsenic.
23603382|a|Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid existing widely in the environment, and chronic exposure to it through contaminated drinking water has become a global problem of public health. The present study focused on the protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage of chronic arsenic poisoning in rat liver. Rats were divided into four groups at random and given designed treatments for 20weeks. The oxidative damage of liver tissue was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative stress related genes were detected to reflect the liver stress state at the molecular level. Compared to the control and Na2SeO3 groups, the MDA content in liver tissue was decreased and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the Na2SeO3 intervention group. The mRNA levels of SOD1, CAT, GPx and Txnrd1 were increased significantly (P<0.05) in the combined Na2SeO3+NaAsO2 treatment group. The expressions of HSP70 and HO-1 were significantly (P<0.05) increased in the NaAsO2 group and reduced in the combined treatment group. The results indicate that long-term intake of NaAsO2 causes oxidative damage in the rat liver, and Na2SeO3 protects liver cells by adjusting the expression of oxidative stress related genes to improve the activities of antioxidant enzymes.

23604720|t|Aldose Reductase Inhibitory Compounds from Xanthium strumarium.
23604720|a|As part of our ongoing search for natural sources of therapeutic and preventive agents for diabetic complications, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of components of the fruit of Xanthium strumarium (X. strumarium) on aldose reductase (AR) and galactitol formation in rat lenses with high levels of glucose. To identify the bioactive components of X. strumarium, 7 caffeoylquinic acids and 3 phenolic compounds were isolated and their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic evidence and comparison with published data. The abilities of 10 X. strumarium-derived components to counteract diabetic complications were investigated by means of inhibitory assays with rat lens AR (rAR) and recombinant human AR (rhAR). From the 10 isolated compounds, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed the most potent inhibition, with IC50 values of 0.30 and 0.67 μM for rAR and rhAR, respectively. In the kinetic analyses using Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/velocity and 1/substrate, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed competitive inhibition of rhAR. Furthermore, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate inhibited galactitol formation in the rat lens and in erythrocytes incubated with a high concentration of glucose, indicating that this compound may be effective in preventing diabetic complications.

23604819|t|Synthesis, cytotoxicity and QSAR study of N-tosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives.
23604819|a|1-Substituted-N-tosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline analogs (4a-4l) were synthesized using the modified Pictet-Spengler reaction and evaluated for cytotoxicity. All tetrahydroisoquinolines displayed cytotoxicity against MOLT-3 cell lines, except for p-methoxy analog 4d. Interestingly, the o-hydroxy derivative 4k was shown to be the most potent cytotoxic against HuCCA-1, A-549 and MOLT-3 cell lines. The lowest IC50 value of 1.23 μM was observed for MOLT-3 cells. Trimethoxy analog 4f exerted the most potent activity against HepG2 with an IC50 of 22.70 μM, which is lower than the reference drug, etoposide. QSAR studies showed that total symmetry index (Gu), 3D-MoRSE (Mor31v and Mor32u) and 3D Petitjean index (PJI3) were the most important descriptors accounting for the observed cytotoxicities. The most potent cytotoxic compound (4k) against MOLT-3 had the highest Gu value, correspondingly the inactive p-methoxy analog (4d) had the lowest Gu value. On the other hand, the highest molecular mass compound (4f) was shown to be the most potent cytotoxic against HepG2 cells. The studies disclose that tetrahydroisoquinolines 4f and 4k are potentially interesting lead pharmacophores that should be further explored. The QSAR models provided insights into the physicochemical properties of the investigated compounds.

23606243|t|Hydrothermal Growth of TiO2 Nanorod Arrays and In Situ Conversion to Nanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Quantum Dot-Sensitized Solar Cells.
23606243|a|TiO2 nanorod (NR) and nanotube (NT) arrays grown on transparent conductive substrates are attractive electrode for solar cells. In this paper, TiO2 NR arrays are hydrothermally grown on FTO substrate, and are in situ converted into NT arrays by hydrothermally etching. The TiO2 NR arrays are reported as single crystalline, but the TiO2 NR arrays are demonstrated to be polycrystalline with a bundle of 2-5 nm single crystalline nanocolumns grown along [001] throughout the whole NR from bottom to top. TiO2 NRs can be converted to NTs by hydrothermal selective etching of the (001) core and remaining the inert sidewall of (110) face. A growth mechanism of the NR and NT arrays is proposed. Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are fabricated by coating CdSe QDs on to the TiO2 arrays. After conversion from NRs to NTs, more QDs can be filled in the NTs and the energy conversion efficiency of the QDSCs almost double.

23608239|t|Protective effect of ethyl acetate fraction of Acacia ferruginea DC. against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats.
23608239|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In traditional systems of medicine, stem bark of Acacia ferruginea DC. is used for the treatment of itching, leucoderma, ulcers, stomatitis and diseases of the blood. In the present study, we determined antioxidant and anti-ulcerogenic activities of Acacia ferruginea stem bark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acetone extract and its sub-fractions of Acacia ferruginea stem bark were subjected to assess their antioxidant potential using various in vitro systems such as DPPH(•), ABTS(•+) scavenging, FRAP and phosphomolybdenum reduction activities. Based on the antioxidant potential, the ethyl acetate fraction was used to evaluate the protective effect of ethanol-induced gastric damage in rat model. Enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione, catalase and lipid peroxidation were also determined in the stomach tissues. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate fraction (AFE) of Acacia ferruginea stem bark registered higher antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities than the crude acetone extract and other fractions. In addition, AFE exhibited that the IC50 values of DPPH (2.5µg/ml) and ABTS (1.8µg/ml) were lower when compared to the standard quercetin (12.4µg/ml and 4.7µg/ml, respectively). In ethanol induced gastric ulcer, administration of AFE at doses of 10mg/kg, 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg body weight prior to ethanol ingestion significantly protected the stomach ulceration. Consequently significant changes were observed in enzyme activities such as SOD, CAT, GSH and LPO in the stomach tissues when compared with ethanol control group. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the ethyl acetate fraction of Acacia ferruginea stem bark possessed higher antioxidant and anti-ulcerogenic activities. Based on the results we suggest that Acacia ferruginea stem bark has potential to provide a therapeutic approach to ethanol mediated ulcer as an effective anti-ulcer agent.

23608535|t|MAPKAPK2/3 Regulate SERCA2a Expression and Fiber Type Composition to Modulate Skeletal Muscle and Cardiomyocyte Function.
23608535|a|The MAPK-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 (MAPKAPK2/3, MK2/3) represent protein kinases downstream of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Using MK2/3 double knockout mice (MK2/3(-/-)), we analyzed the role of MK2/3 in cross-striated muscle by transcriptome and proteome analyses, and by histology. We demonstrated enhanced expression of the slow oxidative skeletal muscle myofiber gene program, including the PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Using reporter gene and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays we demonstrated that MK2 catalytic activity directly regulated the promoters of the fast fiber-specific myosin heavy chain IId/x and the slow fiber-specific sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) 2 gene. Elevated SERCA2a gene expression caused by a decreased transcription factor Egr-1 to Sp1 ratio was associated with accelerated relaxation and enhanced contractility in MK2/3(-/-) cardiomyocytes, concomitant with improved force parameters in MK2/3(-/-) soleus muscle. These results link MK2/3 to the regulation of calcium dynamics and identify enzymatic activity of MK2/3 as a critical factor for modulating cross-striated muscle function by generating a unique muscle phenotype exhibiting both, reduced fatigability and enhanced force in MK2/3(-/-) mice. Hence, the p38-MK2/3 axis may represent a novel target for the design of therapeutic strategies for diseases related to fiber type changes or impaired SERCA2 function.

23611809|t|Human UGT2B10 in Drug N-glucuronidations: Substrate Screening and Comparison with UGT1A3 and UGT1A4.
23611809|a|Recent observations revealed that human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B10 catalyzes N-glucuronidation of amine-containing compounds. Knowledge of the substrate specificity and clinical significance of UGT2B10 is still limited. The purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge of UGT2B10 substrates and to evaluate its significance in drug clearance. Using recombinant UGT2B10, we found that it catalyzes the N-glucuronidation of amitriptyline, imipramine, ketotifen, pizotifen, olanzapine, diphenhydramine, tamoxifen, ketoconazole and midazolam. These are drugs that were previously reported to be substrates for UGT1A4 or UGT1A3 and that contain in their structure either tertiary aliphatic amines, cyclic amines, or an imidazole group. UGT2B10 was inactive in the glucuronidation of desipramine, nortriptyline, carbamazepine and afloqualone. This group of drugs contains secondary or primary amines, and these results suggest that UGT2B10 preferably conjugates tertiary amines. This preference is partial because UGT2B10 did not conjugate the tertiary cyclic amine in trifluoperazine. Kinetic analyses revealed that the affinity and clearance of UGT2B10 for amitriptyline, imipramine, and diphenhydramine are significantly higher than the corresponding values of UGT1A4 and UGT1A3, although the Vmax values of UGT1A4 toward these drugs are considerably higher. These findings suggest that UGT2B10 plays a major role in the N-glucuronidation of these drugs at therapeutic concentrations. These results are also supported by inhibition studies with nicotine and hecogenin. In conclusion, this study expands the understanding of the substrate specificity of UGT2B10, highlighting its preference for tertiary amines with higher affinities and clearance values than those of UGT1A4 and UGT1A3.

23611835|t|Molecular Mechanisms of the antitumor activity of SB225002: A novel microtubule inhibitor.
23611835|a|SB225002 (SB) is an IL-8 receptor B (IL-8RB) antagonist that has previously been shown to inhibit IL-8-based cancer cell invasion, and to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. The present study presented an evidence for the cell cycle-targeting activity of SB in a panel of p53-mutant human cancer cell lines of different origin, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. A combination of cell cycle analysis, immunocytometry, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that SB induced a BubR1-dependent mitotic arrest. Mechanistically, SB was shown to possess a microtubule destabilizing activity evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 and BclxL, suppression of microtubule polymerization and induction of a prometaphase arrest. Molecular docking studies suggested that SB has a good affinity towards vinblastine-binding site on β-tubulin subunit. Of note, SB265610 which is a close structural analogue of SB225002 with a potent IL-8RB antagonistic activity did not exhibit a similar antimitotic activity. Importantly, in P-glycoprotein overexpressing NCI/Adr-Res cells the antitumor activity of SB was unaffected by multidrug resistance. Interestingly, the mechanisms of SB-induced cell death were cell-line dependent, where in invasive hepatocellular carcinoma HLE cells the significant contribution of BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis was demonstrated. Conversely, SB activated p38 MAPK signaling in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells SW480, and pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity revealed its key role in mediating SB-induced caspase-independent cell death. In summary, the present study introduced SB as a promising antitumor agent which has the potential to exert its activity through dual mechanisms involving microtubules targeting and interference with IL-8-drivin cancer progression.

23614643|t|Dimerized Glycosaminoglycan Chains Increase FGF Signaling during Zebrafish Development.
23614643|a|Proteoglycans (PGs) modulate numerous signaling pathways during development through binding of their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains to various signaling molecules, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). A majority of PGs possess two or more GAG side chains, suggesting that GAG multivalency is imperative for biological functions in vivo. However, only a few studies have examined the biological significance of GAG multivalency. In this report, we utilized a library of bis- and tris-xylosides that produce two and three GAG chains on the same scaffold, respectively, thus mimicking PGs, to examine the importance of GAG valency and chain type in regulating FGF/FGFR interactions in vivo in zebrafish. A number of bis- and tris-xylosides, but not mono-xylosides, caused an elongation phenotype upon their injection into embryos. In situ hybridization showed that elongated embryos have elevated expression of the FGF target gene mkp3 but unchanged expression of reporters for other pathways, indicating that FGF/FGFR signaling was specifically hyperactivated. In support of this observation, elongation can be reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402, mRNA for the FGFR antagonist sprouty4, or FGF8 morpholino. Endogenous GAGs seem to be unaffected after xyloside treatment, suggesting that this is a gain-of-function phenotype. Furthermore, expression of a multivalent but not a monovalent GAG containing syndecan-1 proteoglycan recapitulates the elongation phenotype observed with the bivalent xylosides. On the basis of these in vivo findings, we propose a new model for GAG/FGF/FGFR interactions in which dimerized GAG chains can activate FGF-mediated signal transduction pathways.

23615471|t|Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester Suppresses Proliferation and Survival of TW2.6 Human Oral Cancer Cells via Inhibition of Akt Signaling.
23615471|a|Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Our observations indicated that CAPE treatment suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of TW2.6 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells dose-dependently. CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3β, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-κB, phospho-NF-κB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition. Our study suggested that administration of CAPE is a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with OSCC oral cancer.

23618921|t|Concurrent Regulation of the Transcription Factors Nrf2 and ATF4 Mediates the Enhancement of Glutathione Levels by the Flavonoid Fisetin.
23618921|a|Glutathione (GSH) and GSH-associated metabolism provide the major line of defense for the protection of cells from various forms of toxic stress. GSH also plays a key role in regulating the intracellular redox environment. Thus, maintenance of GSH levels is developing into an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Among the transcription factors that play critical roles in GSH metabolism are NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Thus, compounds that can upregulate these transcription factors may be particularly useful as treatment options through their effects on GSH metabolism. We previously showed that the flavonoid fisetin not only increases basal levels of GSH but also maintains GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained unknown until now. Here we show that fisetin rapidly increases the levels of both Nrf2 and ATF4 as well as Nrf2- and ATF4-dependent gene transcription via distinct mechanisms. Although fisetin greatly increases the stability of both Nrf2 and ATF4, only the effect on ATF4 is dependent on protein kinase activity. Using siRNA we found that ATF4, but not Nrf2, is important for fisetin's ability to increase GSH levels under basal conditions whereas both ATF4 and Nrf2 appear to cooperate to increase GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. Based upon these results, we hypothesize that compounds able to increase GSH levels via multiple mechanisms, such as fisetin, will be particularly effective for maintaining GSH levels under a variety of different stresses.

23621358|t|GALACTOSYLATED MICELLES FOR A RIBAVIRIN PRODRUG TARGETING TO HEPATOCYTES.
23621358|a|Polymeric micelles potentially able to carry to hepatocytes a ribavirin (RBV) prodrug, exploiting the presence of carbohydrate receptors, i.e., ASGPR, were prepared starting from a galactosylated polylactide-polyaminoacid conjugate. This latter was obtained by chemical reaction of alpha,beta-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl) (2-aminoethylcarbamate)-DL-aspartamide (PHEA-EDA) with polylactic acid (PLA), and subsequent reaction with lactose, obtaining PHEA-EDA-PLA-GAL copolymer. To enhance the entrapment into obtained nanostructures, a hydrophobic RBV prodrug, i.e. RBV tripalmitate, was synthesized and its capability to release RBV in the presence of an adequate enzymatic activity was demonstrated. Liver-targeted RBV tripalmitate-loaded micelles were obtained in aqueous media at low PHEA-EDA-PLA-GAL copolymer concentration value with nanometric size. By in vitro experiments, the specificity of RBV tripalmitate-loaded PHEA-EDA-PLA-GAL micelles toward HepG2 was demonstrated by using a competitive inhibition assay in the presence of free GAL. This finding raises hope in terms of future micelles-based liver-targeted drug delivery strategy for the hepatitis C treatment.

23623750|t|Molecular and functional characterization of flavin-containing monooxygenases in cynomolgus macaque.
23623750|a|Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), drug-metabolizing enzymes essential for the metabolism of endogenous biochemicals and foreign compounds, have been characterized in human (including FMO1-5 and FMO6P), but remain to be investigated in cynomolgus macaque. In this study, cDNAs of cynomolgus FMO1-5 and FMO6 were isolated and characterized. Amino acid sequences of cynomolgus FMO1-5, respectively, shared high sequence identities (94-98%) and were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree, with human FMO1-5. Eight different transcripts, due to alternative splicing, were isolated for cynomolgus FMO6, which is highly identical (∼96%) to human FMO6P. Among the 10 tissue types analyzed, cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO4, and FMO6 were most abundantly expressed in kidney, while cynomolgus FMO3 and FMO5 were most abundantly expressed in liver. In kidney and liver, the most abundantly expressed cynomolgus FMO genes were FMO1 and FMO3 respectively. Cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 metabolized benzydamine, and FMO1/FMO3 and FMO3 also metabolized methimazole and trimethylamine, respectively. Rates of benzydamine N-oxygenation (catalyzed by FMO3) varied (approximately 20-fold) among the 28 cynomolgus livers and were significantly correlated with FMO3 protein expression, indicating that the inter-animal variations in benzydamine N-oxygenation might be partly accounted for by the variable FMO3 expression. Cynomolgus FMO6 metabolized benzydamine only slightly, but minimal expression of FMO6 in all tissue precludes the importance of FMO6 in drug metabolism, unlike cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 which were all functional. Abundant expression of FMO1 and FMO3 in kidney and liver, respectively, suggest their importance in drug metabolism in cynomolgus macaque, similar to human.

23625813|t|Glomerular Filtration Rate Equations Overestimate Creatinine Clearance in Older Individuals Enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging: Impact on Renal Drug Dosing.
23625813|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of kidney function estimation equations and to determine the frequency of drug dose discordance in an older population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from community-dwelling volunteers randomly selected from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. SUBJECTS: A total of 269 men and women with a mean ± SD age of 81 ± 6 years, mean serum creatinine concentration (Scr ) of 1.1 ± 0.4 mg/dl, and mean 24-hour measured creatinine clearance (mClcr ) of 53 ± 13 ml/minute. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Kidney function was estimated by using the following equations: Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI). The performance of each equation was assessed by measuring bias and precision relative to mClcr . Dose calculation errors (discordance) were determined for 10 drugs requiring renal dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity when compared with the dosages approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The CG equation was the least biased estimate of mClcr . The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations were significantly positively biased compared with CG (mean ± SD 34 ± 20% and 22 ± 15%, respectively, p<0.001) and mClcr (29 ± 47% and 18 ± 40%, respectively, p<0.001). Rounding low Scr values (less than 1.0 mg/dl) up to an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg/dl resulted in CG values (44 ± 10 ml/minute) that were significantly lower than mClcr (56 ± 12 ml/minute, p<0.001) and CG (56 ± 15 ml/minute, p<0.001). The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations had median dose discordance rates of 28.6% and 22.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations significantly overestimated creatinine clearance (mClcr and CG) in elderly individuals. This leads to dose calculation errors for many drugs, particularly in individuals with severe renal impairment. Thus equations estimating glomerular filtration rate should not be substituted in place of the CG equation in older adults for the purpose of renal dosage adjustments. In addition, the common practice of rounding or replacing low Scr values with an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg/dl for use in the CG equation should be avoided. Additional studies that evaluate alternative eGFR equations in the older populations that incorporate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes measures are needed.

23625910|t|Effect of paraoxonase 1 192 Q/R polymorphism on paraoxonase and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activities in Turkish population exposed to organophosphate.
23625910|a|Organophosphate (OP) compounds are the most commonly used pesticide groups and they are commercially used in the market for local and industrial purposes. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzyme plays an important role in biotransformation of OP compounds, which shows toxic effects via inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PON1 gene polymorphism and its effects on PON and AChE enzyme activities in individuals who were exposed to organophosphorus insecticides due to occupational reasons, and to profile the probability of susceptibility to organophosphorus compounds. For this purpose, 54 individuals who were exposed to OPs and 54 healthy unrelated controls were studied. First, PON1 and AChE enzyme activities were measured. Second, PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism was determined by standard polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. When the PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism was compared with PON1 enzyme activities, statistically significant association was found in both OP-exposed and control groups (p < 0.05). PON1 192 R(+) (QR + RR genotypes) genotype carriers had higher PON1 activities than 192 R(-) (QQ) genotype carriers. On the other hand, results were statistically analyzed in terms of AChE enzyme activities and there were statistically significant differences only in the OP-exposed group (p < 0.05). The mean AChE concentration in the OP-exposed group was determined as 33.79 ± 6.84 U/g haemoglobin (Hb) for PON1 192 R(+) carriers and 30.37 ± 7.62 U/g Hb for PON1 192 R(+) carriers. As a conclusion, PON1 and AChE activities were increasing according to the genotypes found in individuals having been exposed to OPs at a chronic level; 192 R(+) > 192 R(-), respectively.

23625915|t|Store-operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) Induced by Protease-activated Receptor-1 mediates STIM1 Phosphorylation to inhibit SOCE in Endothelial Cells through AMP-activated Protein Kinase and p38beta Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase.
23625915|a|The Ca2+ sensor STIM1 is crucial for activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through TRPC and Orai channels. STIM1 phosphorylation serves as an off-switch for SOCE. However, the signaling pathway for STIM1 phosphorylation is unknown. Here we show that SOCE activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); its effector p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38β MAPK) phosphorylates STIM1, thus inhibiting SOCE in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AMPK using AICAR resulted in STIM1 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented PAR-1-induced Ca2+ entry. Further, AICAR pretreatment blocked PAR-1-induced increase in permeability of mouse-lung microvessels. Activation of SOCE with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform α1, but not α2 of the AMPK catalytic subunit. Moreover, knockdown of AMPKα1 augmented SOCE induced by thrombin. Interestingly, SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked STIM1 phosphorylation and led to sustained STIM1-puncta formation and Ca2+ entry. Of the three p38 MAPK isoforms expressed in ECs, p38β knockdown prevented PAR-1-mediated STIM1 phosphorylation and potentiated SOCE. In addition, inhibition of the SOCE downstream target CaMKKβ or knockdown of AMPKα1 suppressed PAR-1-mediated phosphorylation of p38β and hence STIM1. Thus, our findings demonstrate that SOCE activates CaMKKβ-AMPKα1-p38β MAPK signaling to phosphorylate STIM1, thereby suppressing endothelial SOCE and permeability responses.

23628454|t|Scientific evidence for traditional claim of antiobesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark.
23628454|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The bark of Tecomella undulata is traditionally claimed in the treatment of various disease ailments including obesity and cancer. Till now there are no studies about anti obesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to establish a scientific evidence for anti obesity efficiency of ethyl acetate extract of Tecomella undulata bark (EATUB). Further to standardize the active fractions of EATUB using different biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated activity of EATUB fractions (F1-F7) using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Further, F1-mediated effects were characterized by determining mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, one of the key targets for the treatment of obesity, using semi quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The consequences of modulation of SIRT1 on mRNA and protein levels of various adipogenesis mediators like PPARγ, C/EBPα, E2F1, leptin, adiponectin and LPL were also studied. In-vivo studies were performed using High Fat Diet (HFD) obese mice. RESULTS: Our data showed that compared to controls, preadipocytes and adipocytes incubated with F1 exhibited a significant decrease in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. In addition, sqRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed significant increase in SIRT1 and adiponectin levels and decrease in PPARγ, C/EBPα, E2F1, leptin and LPL levels in preadipocytes and adipocytes. In-vivo studies of F1 in HFD induced obese mice showed significant improvement in lipid profile and glucose levels. The bioactive fraction (F1) was determined to possess 4.95% of ferulic acid. CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings signified the beneficial effects of Tecomella undulata bark in pharmacologic interventions related to obesity and metabolic disorders. Ferulic acid and rutin are being reported and quantified for the first time from the bark of Tecomella undulata.

23628605|t|Steroid hormone synthesis in mitochondria.
23628605|a|Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.

23631440|t|Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors Based on the 3-Mercaptopyrrolidine Core.
23631440|a|New series of pyrrolidine mercaptosulfide, 2-mercaptocyclopentane arylsulfonamide, and 3-mercapto-4-arylsulfonamido pyrrolidine matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Exhibiting unique properties over other MMPIs (e.g., hydroxamates), these newly reported compounds are capable of modulating activities of several MMPs in the low nanomolar range, including MMP-2 (~2 to 50 nM), MMP-13 (~2 to 50 nM), and MMP-14 (~4 to 60 nM). Additionally these compounds are selective to intermediate- and deep-pocket MMPs but not shallow-pocketed MMPs (e.g., MMP-1, ~850 to >50,000 nM; MMP-7, ~4,000 to >25,000 nM). Our previous work with the mercaptosulfide functionality attached to both cyclopentane and pyrrolidine frameworks demonstrated that the cis-(3S,4R)- stereochemistry was optimal for all of the MMPs tested. However, in our newest compounds an interesting shift of preference to the trans- form of the mercaptosulfonamides was observed with increased oxidative stability and biological compatibility. We also report several kinetic and biological characteristics showing that these compounds may be used to probe the mechanistic activities of MMPs in disease.

23633618|t|A Structural Snapshot of Cytochrome P450 2B4 in Complex with Paroxetine Provides Insights into Ligand Binding and Clusters of Conformational States.
23633618|a|An X-ray crystal structure of cytochrome P450 2B4 in complex with the drug paroxetine was solved at 2.14 Å resolution. The structure revealed a conformation intermediate to that of the recently solved complex with amlodipine and of the more compact complex with 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole in terms of the placement of the F-G cassette. Moreover, the comparison of the new structure with 15 previously solved structures of P450 2B4 revealed some new insights into determinants of active site size and shape. The 2B4-paroxetine structure is nearly superimposable on a previously solved closed structure in a ligand free state. Despite the overall conformational similarity among multiple closed structures, the active site cavity volume of the paroxetine complex is enlarged. Further analysis of the accessible space and binding pocket near the heme reveals a new sub-chamber that resulted from the movement of secondary structural elements and rearrangements of active site side chains. Overall, the results from the comparison of all the 16 structures of P450 2B4 demonstrate a cluster of protein conformations that were observed in the presence or absence of various ligands.

23638842|t|Protective Role of (RS )-glucoraphanin Bioactivated with Myrosinase in an Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis.
23638842|a|AIM: The discovery of new natural compounds with pharmacological properties is a field of interest widely growing. Recent literature shows that Brassica vegetables (Cruciferae) possess therapeutic effects particularly ascribed due to their content in glucosinolates, which upon myrosinase hydrolysis release the corresponding isothiocyanates. This study examines the potential neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of (RS )-glucoraphanin from Tuscan black kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala sabellica) bioactivated with myrosinase (bioactive RS -GRA) (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: EAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55 ) in mice. After immunization, mice were observed daily for signs of EAE and weight loss. Clinical score was evaluated using a standardized scoring system. RESULTS: By Western blot analysis of spinal cord tissues, we have demonstrated that treatment with bioactive RS -GRA significantly decreased nuclear factor (NF)-kB translocation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and apoptosis (Bax and caspase 3 expression). CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrate that bioactive RS -GRA treatment may represent a useful therapeutic perspective in the treatment of this disease.

23639191|t|Involvement of p-CREB and phase II detoxifying enzyme system in neuroprotection mediated by the flavonoid calycopterin isolated from Dracocephalum kotschyi.
23639191|a|PURPOSE: There is an increasing amount of experimental evidence that oxidative stress has a central role in the neuropathology of neurodegenerative diseases. It has been suggested that the loss of cell function results from the increased oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Herein, we investigated the effect of a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, calycopterin, on H2O2-induced disruption of phase II detoxifying enzyme system and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100μM of calycopterin for 3h, followed by adding H2O2 (150μM) for 24h. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by comet assay. The level of phosphorylated CREB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were measured by western blot method. The concentration of glutathione (GSH) was determined in whole cell lysate using dithionitrobenzoic acid method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by colorimetric assay. RESULT: Morphological analysis of protection induced by calycopterin, determined by comet assay, showed that calycopterin reduced DNA in tail. We found that H2O2 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while, calycopterin prevented this decrease in MMP in presence of H2O2. In H2O2-treated cells, calycopterin also suppressed cytochrome C release to cytosol that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in survived cells. Moreover, calycopterin, in presence of H2O2 inhibited the decrease caused by oxidative stress in stress-sensing transcription factors, CREB and Nrf2, which play an important role in antioxidant capacity of the cell. There was also an increase in γ-GCS and HO-1 levels in calycopterin pretreated cells. In the presence of H2O2, calycopterin inhibited decrease in GSH level and SOD activity. CONCLUSION: We provided documentation of neuroprotective effect of a natural flavone, calycopterin, against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in differentiated PC12 cells by modulating the level of CREB phosphorylation and Nrf2 pathway.

23639249|t|Indoxyl 3-sulfate stimulates Th17 differentiation enhancing phosphorylation of c-Src and STAT3 to worsen experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
23639249|a|Although AhR activation regulates CD4T cell differentiation, how it works has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, using in vitro Th17 differentiation model, we examined effects of AhR activation by indoxyl 3-sulfate (I3S), a uremic toxin, on Th17 differentiation and investigated underlying mechanisms. I3S increased expression of RORγt, the master transcription factor for Th17 differentiation, and stimulated Th17 differentiation, in a comparative manner as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a prototypical AhR ligand. Activation of STAT3, which is phosphorylated by the IL-6 signaling pathways and thus is necessary for Th17 differentiation, was strongly stimulated by I3S and TCDD. Phosphorylation of c-Src, which was shown to be activated by AhR ligands, was also increased by I3S and TCDD, and blocking of c-Src activity by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) inhibited phosphorylation of both c-Src and STAT3, raising a possibility that stimulatory activities of I3S and TCDD on Th17 differentiation could be exerted via increased phosphorylation of c-Src, which in turn stimulates STAT3 activation. Finally, we found that I3S worsened experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is primarily mediated by Th17 cells, enhancing the frequency of IL-17-producing cells in draining lymph nodes.

23639586|t|Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis of hepatotoxicity induced by triptolide in Wistar rats.
23639586|a|Triptolide (TP), a major component of TWHF, is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis and leprosy. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of its hepatotoxic effects, hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed. TP (1000 and 300μg/kg) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 14days. Current study indicated that female rats were more sensitive to TP-induced hepatotoxicity than males. Genome-wide microarray analyses identified 3329 differentially expressed genes in liver of female rats. Analyses of these genes identified over-represented functions associated with insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which were consistent with the results of significant increase of Caspase-3 activity and reduction of serum glucose, GSH/GSSG ratio, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities, liver glycogen. In addition, it was observed for the first time that glucocorticoids and IGF1 might get involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. These data suggest that TP treatment could alter the hepatic redox status, reduce serum glucose and induce hepatocyte apoptosis, consistent with the differential expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway and cell stress pathway, all of which might contribute to the overall TP-induced hepatotoxicity.

23639626|t|TCDD induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 in 5L rat hepatoma cells: a cautionary tale of the use of this cell line in studies on dioxin toxicity.
23639626|a|Previous quantitative proteomic studies on the actions of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in 5L rat hepatoma cells, a cell model frequently used for investigating the mechanisms of TCDD toxicity, had indicated that dioxin exposure reduced the abundance of numerous proteins which are regulated at the level of protein synthesis initiation. In the present study, we have analysed the mechanism mediating this inhibition. TCDD treatment of the cells largely prevented the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, a regulator of translation initiation and substrate of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). By "working upwards" from mTOR, we observed that TCDD inhibited endogenous and IGF-I-induced AKT and ERK activation by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. This inhibition was mediated by a TCDD-induced secreted factor which was identified as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4). The induction of IGFBP-4 protein was dependent on a functional aryl hydrocarbon receptor and was preceded by a rapid increase in the level of IGFBP-4 mRNA indicating that IGFBP-4 is a previously unknown transcriptional target of TCDD in 5L cells. IGFBP-4 was not induced by TCDD in the parental cell line of 5L cells, Fao, and in various closely related rat hepatoma cell lines as well as in other unrelated cell types. Analysis of 5L cell chromosomes by multicolour spectral karyotyping (SKY) revealed that the cells carry several hitherto uncharacterised chromosomal translocations. The observations suggest that in 5L cells the Igfbp-4 gene may have got under the control of a promoter containing dioxin responsive element(s) leading to the induction of IGFBP-4 by TCDD. These findings emphasise a particular caution when interpreting and extrapolating results on the action mechanisms of TCDD obtained in studies using 5L cells as a model system.

23644200|t|Glycosylation enhances the anti-migratory activities of isomalyngamide A analogs.
23644200|a|Three, new, fully synthetic glycosylated isomalyngamide A analogs 4-6 were prepared and evaluated for their anti-migratory activities in human breast cancer cells. The results of the study show that two glycosylated derivatives 4 and 5, containing mannose and galactose appendages, suppress metastatic events (e.g., migration, invasion and adhesion) in human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells at "nontoxic" concentration levels. In contrast, derivative 6 that contains a lactose moiety, displays a less potent activity. The findings show that monosaccharide rather than disaccharide appendages to the isomalyngamide A backbone more greatly influence cell migration and invasive ability. Evidence has been gained for a mechanism for inhibition of metastatic activities in MDA-MB-231 cells by 4 and 5, involving inactivation of the expression of p-FAK and paxillin through the integrin-mediated antimetastatic pathway.

2386945|t|Inhibition of human breast cancer cell proliferation in tissue culture by the neuroleptic agents pimozide and thioridazine.
2386945|a|Permanent cell culture lines derived from human breast cancer tissue are important experimental models in the study of human breast cancer cell proliferation. In the present work, pimozide, thioridazine, W-13, and W-12 were shown to inhibit MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth. The 50% inhibition concentration values determined in two proliferation assays, [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell number, were in close agreement for each compound tested. The order of potency for growth inhibition in the presence of 2% stripped calf serum was pimozide (Ki 2 microM) greater than thioridazine (Ki 5 microM) greater than W-13 (Ki 15 microM) greater than W-12 (Ki 39 microM). Similar concentrations of these compounds blocked estradiol-induced growth of MCF-7 cells, but estrogen receptor (ER) interactions do not seem to be involved. Pimozide and thioridazine had no effect on the estradiol binding properties of the MCF-7 ER, nor did pimozide interfere with the induction of progesterone receptors by estradiol. Furthermore, pimozide also inhibited incorporation of [3H]thymidine into MCF-7 cells stimulated by polypeptide hormones in serum-free medium. The Ki for pimozide in serum-free medium alone, 0.46 microM, was similar to that determined in the presence of insulin (0.42 microM), insulin-like growth factor I (0.54 microM), and epidermal growth factor (0.43 microM). The effects of pimozide on breast cancer cell growth were not limited to the MCF-7 cell line. Pimozide also blocked cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation into the ER-positive T47D and ZR75-1B human breast cancer cell lines and the ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Although numerous mechanisms of action of pimozide and thioridazine have been identified, both drugs are calmodulin antagonists at drug concentrations that inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro. Inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by the selective calmodulin antagonists W-13 and W-12 is consistent with a role for calmodulin antagonism in the broad growth-inhibitory properties of pimozide. We conclude that pimozide and thioridazine may be useful in the control of estradiol- and polypeptide hormone-induced growth of ER-positive and ER-negative human breast tumors.

2506486|t|Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors on levels of catechols and homovanillic acid in striatum and plasma.
2506486|a|Levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) in plasma and the striatium were measured after inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) by clorgyline (4 mg/kg i.p.), MAO-B by (-)deprenyl (1 mg/kg i.p.), both MAO-A and MAO-B by nialamide (75 mg/kg i.p.) or peripheral neuronal MAO by debrisoquin (40 mg/kg i.p.). Levels of HVA in plasma decreased by about 60% after single doses of nialamide or clorgyline, by about 80% after repeated doses of nialamide, by about 40% after a single dose of debrisoquin and by about 50% after repeated doses of debrisoquin. The administration of clorgyline, nialamide or debrisoquin significantly decreased concentrations of DOPAC and DHPG in plasma, whereas (-)deprenyl did not affect levels of DHPG or HVA. None of the MAO inhibitors produced more than about 80% depression of levels of any of the deaminated metabolites. The results suggest that most of the HVA in plasma is derived from deamination of DA by MAO-A in peripheral neurons; that DOPAC in plasma is derived from cells outside the central nervous system; that DHPG in plasma is derived virtually exclusively from the metabolism of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerve endings and that residual levels of HVA after treatment with debrisoquin provide an improved but limited indication of central dopaminergic activity.

2554783|t|The decrease of catalase or esterase D activity in patients with microdeletions of 11p or 13q does not increase their radiosensitivity.
2554783|a|Lymphocyte cultures from patients affected by retinoblastoma (Rb), with or without a microdeletion of chromosome 13, and Wilms tumor (WT), with a microdeletion of chromosome 11p where exposed to gamma-ray radiation during S and G2 phases. Chromatid and chromosome lesions were scored and compared to those observed in controls. No significant differences were detected, neither between patients and controls, nor between patients carrying or not a microdeletion. This lack of difference was unexpected since the genes for catalase and esterase D, also called S-formyl glutathione hydrolase, which are two detoxication enzymes, are deleted in case of microdeletion of 11p and 13q, respectively.

2751392|t|Developmental changes in lactate dehydrogenase-X activity in young jaundiced male rats.
2751392|a|This study was designed to examine the testicular maturation in both jaundiced (jj) and nonjaundiced (Jj) male Gunn rats as indicated by the activity of a testis and sperm-specific enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase-X (LDH-X), and serum testosterone levels. Testicular cytosolic LDH-X activity was determined by oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Serum testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Testicular LDH-X activity increased rapidly between 30 and 50 days of age in both Jj and jj Gunn rats. LDH-X activity was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 and 60 days of age. Testosterone level was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 days of age. LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels were similar for both genotypes at 180 days of age. The delay of testicular maturation in the jaundiced males seems to be due to lower LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels.

2832297|t|Loperamide modifies but does not block the corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced ACTH response in patients with Addison's disease.
2832297|a|The effect of loperamide - a peripheral opiate agonist - on plasma ACTH response to Corticotropin-releasing Hormone (CRH) has been investigated in 6 patients with Addison's disease. After placebo administration CRH induced a marked ACTH increase. After loperamide administration ACTH levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then CRH was still able to induce an ACTH increase; the pattern of ACTH response to CRH was slightly delayed. There was a significant difference between the two ACTH curves after CRH only in the early phase of the response. These data suggest that the inhibitory role of loperamide on ACTH secretion is exerted at supra-pituitary level, although a pituitary site of action can not be excluded.

2857786|t|Self-cancellation of drug properties as a mode of organ selectivity: the antimuscarinic effects of ambenonium.
2857786|a|Ambenonium is known to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and recent data have shown this drug to antagonize muscarinic receptors as well. This latter property was confirmed by Schild analyses of ambenonium-induced blockade of responses to bethanechol in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle, taenia caeci, trachea and rat anococcygeus muscle. Statistical analysis showed ambenonium to be a simple competitive antagonist of responses to bethanechol in these tissues with pKB values in each tissue not significantly different from each other (mean pKB = 6.0). However, considerable variability in pKB estimates was encountered when ambenonium was utilized to block responses to acetylcholine. Ambenonium was a less potent antagonist of tissue responses to acetylcholine, and the underestimation in the pKB (as compared to that obtained with bethanechol) could be eliminated by prior treatment of tissues with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. These data suggested that ambenonium had a dual effect on tissue responses to acetylcholine-producing potentiation by blockade of acetylcholinesterase and concomitant antagonism by blockade of muscarinic receptors. The Schild regressions obtained for ambenonium antagonism of acetylcholine responses formally satisfied criteria for simple competitive antagonism of a homogenous population of receptors (linear regression, slope equal to unity). The fact that these regressions yielded erroneous apparent pKB values suggests how two properties of a drug in one molecule could provide misleading information about drug receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2891463|t|Comparison of ophthalmic beta-blocking agents.
2891463|a|Glaucoma is described, and the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of betaxolol and levobunolol in comparison with timolol are reviewed. Betaxolol and levobunolol are two beta-adrenergic blocking agents being marketed as ophthalmic solutions for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). Betaxolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, while levobunolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Double-blind comparative trials have suggested that betaxolol has an equal to slightly lower efficacy and levobunolol has equal efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) compared with timolol, the first ophthalmic beta blocker. A mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 15-35% occurs with both betaxolol and levobunolol and is reported to be maintained with prolonged use. Betaxolol is associated with a higher (25%) incidence of local ocular adverse reactions than timolol. However, betaxolol produces less systemic beta 2- and possibly beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade than either timolol or levobunolol. Betaxolol may be relatively safer to use in patients with reactive airway disease than either timolol or levobunolol. Levobunolol causes a similar to greater incidence of local ocular adverse reactions and similar systemic beta blockade compared with timolol. Levobunolol may possibly be longer acting than timolol, allowing more patients to be controlled by once-daily dosing. Betaxolol and levobunolol appear to be similar to timolol in controlling IOP in patients with POAG and OHT; additional experience with these agents is needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each agent.

2994716|t|Nucleotide sequence of the gene for human factor IX (antihemophilic factor B).
2994716|a|Two different human genomic DNA libraries were screened for the gene for blood coagulation factor IX by employing a cDNA for the human protein as a hybridization probe. Five overlapping lambda phages were identified that contained the gene for factor IX. The complete DNA sequence of about 38 kilobases for the gene and the adjacent 5' and 3' flanking regions was established by the dideoxy chain termination and chemical degradation methods. The gene contained about 33.5 kilobases of DNA, including seven introns and eight exons within the coding and 3' noncoding regions of the gene. The eight exons code for a prepro leader sequence and 415 amino acids that make up the mature protein circulating in plasma. The intervening sequences range in size from 188 to 9473 nucleotides and contain four Alu repetitive sequences, including one in intron A and three in intron F. A fifth Alu repetitive sequence was found immediately flanking the 3' end of the gene. A 50 base pair insert in intron A was found in a clone from one of the genomic libraries but was absent in clones from the other library. Intron A as well as the 3' noncoding region of the gene also contained alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences that provide potential left-handed helical DNA or Z-DNA structures for the gene. KpnI repetitive sequences were identified in intron D and the region flanking the 5' end of the gene. The 5' flanking region also contained a 1.9-kb HindIII subfamily repeat. The seven introns in the gene for factor IX were located in essentially the same position as the seven introns in the gene for human protein C, while the first three were found in positions identical with those in the gene for human prothrombin.

3004987|t|Purification and characterization of calcitonin receptors in rat kidney membranes by covalent cross-linking techniques.
3004987|a|We have characterized the binding parameters of renal receptors (Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of two binding sites: site I, Ka1 = 1.29 X 10(9) M-1, number of binding sites = 9.9 X 10(6)/micrograms protein; site II, Ka2 = 0.93 X 10(8) M-1, number of binding sites = 4.27 X 10(8)/micrograms protein) and studied the effect of solubilization. The high-affinity sites are preserved during affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080-fold purification of those sites. The lower-affinity sites are also preserved but the overall purification factor is about 40% lower than that obtained using molecular sieving. The purification of the renal calcitonin receptor by molecular sieving (Sephacryl S-200) is accompanied by total loss of the high-affinity site; however, the low-affinity site is enriched over 1642-fold. Binding parameters were obtained for the purified fractions. Synthetic salmon calcitonin was also bound to renal membranes using the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and photo-affinity cross-linking using hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate reagent. Cross-linked receptor eluted in the same volume as solubilized membranes specifically binding salmon calcitonin (S-200 chromatography). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified fractions showed several protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 18 000 Da to 100 000 Da in the presence or absence of a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol). Autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels of cross-linked calcitonin receptor showed only three protein bands specifically binding salmon calcitonin. Their molecular masses were 70 000 Da, 40 000 Da and 33 000 Da respectively. The 40 000-Da molecule represents a major band (47% total binding species). This suggests that these three proteins are the principal components of the calcitonin receptor and that S-S bonds are not involved in the assembly of the receptor subunits.

3094574|t|Tyrosinase catalyzes an unusual oxidative decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxymandelate.
3094574|a|Tyrosinase usually catalyzes the conversion of monophenols to o-diphenols and oxidation of diphenols to the corresponding quinones. However, when 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid was provided as the substrate, it catalyzed an unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction generating 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as the sole product. The identity of the product was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as well as ultraviolet and infrared spectral studies. None of the following enzymes tested catalyzed the new reaction: galactose oxidase, ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate oxidase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and peroxidase. Phenol oxidase inhibitors such as phenylthiourea, potassium cyanide, and sodium azide inhibited the reaction drastically, suggesting the participation of the active site copper of the enzyme in the catalysis. Mimosine, a well-known competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, competitively inhibited the new reaction also. 4-Hydroxymandelic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid neither served as substrates nor inhibited the reaction. Putative intermediates such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol and (3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)formic acid did not accumulate during the reaction. Oxidation to a quinone methide derivative rather than conventional quinone accounts for this unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction. Earlier from this laboratory, we reported the conversion of 4-alkylcatechols to quinone methides catalyzed by a cuticular phenol oxidase [Sugumaran, M., & Lipke, H. (1983) FEBS Lett. 155, 65-68]. Present studies demonstrate that mushroom tyrosinase will also catalyze quinone methide production with the same active site copper if a suitable substrate such as 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid is provided.

3146348|t|Effectors of the activation of human [Glu1]plasminogen by human tissue plasminogen activator.
3146348|a|The activation of human [Glu1]plasminogen [( Glu1]Pg) by human recombinant (rec) two-chain tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is inhibited by Cl-, at physiological concentrations, and stimulated by epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), as well as fibrin(ogen). Chloride functions as a result of its binding to [Glu1]Pg, with a Ki of approximately 9.0 mM, thereby rendering [Glu1]Pg a less effective substrate for two-chain rec-t-PA. EACA stimulates the activation in Cl-(-)containing solutions, with a Ka of approximately 4.0 mM, primarily by reversal of the Cl-(-)inhibitory effect. Fibrinogen appears to exert its stimulatory properties mainly through effects on the enzyme, two-chain rec-t-PA, with a Ka of approximately 3.7 microM in activation systems containing physiological levels of Cl-. Analysis of the results of this paper reveals that normal plasma components, Cl- and fibrinogen, exert major regulatory roles on the ability of [Glu1]Pg to be activated by two-chain rec-t-PA, in in vitro systems. The presence of Cl- inhibits the stimulation of [Glu1]Pg activation that would normally occur in the presence of fibrinogen, a result of possible importance to the observation that some degree of systemic fibrinogenolysis accompanies therapeutic use of tissue plasminogen activator.

3812589|t|Vitamin B12 responsive homocystinuria and megaloblastic anemia: heterogeneity in methylcobalamin deficiency.
3812589|a|A male infant with methyl-B12 deficiency (cblE) presented at age 6 weeks with lethargy, staring spells, and vomiting. He later became hypotonic and unresponsive to stimuli and required intubation and ventilation. He had homocystinuria and hypomethioninemia with megaloblastic anemia but normal serum folate and vitamin B12 concentrations. No methylmalonic aciduria was detected. Fibroblasts, cultured from the patient, were unable to grow in medium in which homocysteine replaced methionine and incorporated abnormally small amounts of [14C]-methyl-tetrahydrofolate but normal amounts of [14C]-propionate into protein. Methyl-B12 content of fibroblasts was low, while the adenosyl-B12 content was normal. Methionine synthase activity was decreased when the assay was performed under both optimal and suboptimal reducing conditions, suggesting heterogeneity in the cblE disease. The patient responded dramatically to hydroxocobalamin treatment. Homocystinuria disappeared after 10 days of therapy, and methionine was normalized after 3 weeks. Psychometric testing at age 15 months showed a developmental age of 9 months.

6725552|t|Inactivation of factor XII active fragment in normal plasma. Predominant role of C-1-inhibitor.
6725552|a|To define the factors responsible for the inactivation of the active fragment derived from Factor XII (Factor XIIf ) in plasma, we studied the inactivation kinetics of Factor XIIf in various purified and plasma mixtures. We also analyzed the formation of 125I-Factor XIIf -inhibitor complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In purified systems, the bimolecular rate constants for the reactions of Factor XIIf with C-1-inhibitor, alpha 2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III were 18.5, 0.91, and 0.32 X 10(4) M-1 min-1, respectively. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that 1:1 stoichiometric complexes were formed between 125I-Factor XIIf and each of these three inhibitors. In contrast, kinetic and SDS-PAGE studies indicated that Factor XIIf did not react with alpha 1-antitrypsin or alpha 2-macroglobulin. The inactivation rate constant of Factor XIIf by prekallikrein-deficient plasma was 14.4 X 10(-2) min-1, a value that was essentially identical to the value predicted from the studies in purified systems (15.5 X 10(-2) min-1). This constant was reduced to 1.8 X 10(-2) min-1 when Factor XIIf was inactivated by prekallikrein-deficient plasma that had been immunodepleted (less than 5%) of C-1-inhibitor. In addition, after inactivation in normal plasma, 74% of the active 125I-Factor XIIf was found to form a complex with C-1-inhibitor, whereas 26% of the enzyme formed complexes with alpha 2-antiplasmin and antithrombin III. Furthermore, 42% of the labeled enzyme was still complexed with C-1-inhibitor when 125I-Factor XII was inactivated in hereditary angioedema plasma that contained 32% of functional C-1-inhibitor. This study quantitatively demonstrates the dominant role of C-1-inhibitor in the inactivation of Factor XIIf in the plasma milieu.

7500004|t|Sodium-dependent norepinephrine-induced currents in norepinephrine-transporter-transfected HEK-293 cells blocked by cocaine and antidepressants.
7500004|a|Transport of norepinephrine (NE+) by cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive transporters in presynaptic terminals is predicted to involve the cotransport of Na+ and Cl-, resulting in a net movement of charge per transport cycle. To explore the relationship between catecholamine transport and ion permeation through the NE transporter, we established a human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) cell line suitable for biochemical analysis and patch-clamp recording. Stable transfection of hNET cDNA into HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells results in lines exhibiting (1) a high number of transporter copies per cell (10(6)), as detected by radioligand binding and hNET-specific antibodies, (2) high-affinity, Na(+)-dependent transport of NE, and (3) inhibitor sensitivities similar to those of native membranes. Whole-cell voltage-clamp of hNET-293 cells reveals NE-induced, Na(+)-dependent currents blocked by antidepressants and cocaine that are absent in parental cells. In addition to NE-dependent currents, transfected cells posses an NE-independent mode of charge movement mediated by hNET. hNET antagonists without effect in non-transfected cells abolish both NE-dependent and NE-independent modes of charge movement in transfected cells. The magnitude of NE-dependent currents in these cells exceeds the expectations of simple carrier models using previous estimates of transport rates. To explain our observations, we propose that hNETs function as ion-gated ligand channels with an indefinite stoichiometry relating ion flux to NE transport. In this view, external Na+ and NE bind to the transporter with finite affinities in a cooperative fashion. However, coupled transport may not predict the magnitude or the kinetics of the total current through the transporter. We propose instead that Na+ gates NE transport and also the parallel inward flux of an indeterminate number of ions through a channel-like pore.

7516184|t|TSG-6, an arthritis-associated hyaluronan binding protein, forms a stable complex with the serum protein inter-alpha-inhibitor.
7516184|a|TSG-6 is a secreted 35-kDa glycoprotein, inducible by TNF and IL-1. The N-terminal portion of TSG-6 shows sequence homology to members of the cartilage link protein family of hyaluronan binding proteins. The C-terminal half of TSG-6 contains a so-called CUB domain, characteristic for developmentally regulated proteins. High levels of TSG-6 protein are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and some other arthritic diseases. Here we show that TSG-6 readily formed a complex with a protein present in human, bovine, rabbit, and mouse serum. This complex was stable during SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and in the presence of 8 M urea. The protein that binds TSG-6 was purified from human serum and identified as inter-alpha-inhibitor (I alpha I) by N-terminal microsequencing. Microsequencing of the complex itself revealed the presence of TSG-6 and two of the three polypeptide chains of I alpha I (bikunin and HC2). Experiments with recombinant TSG-6 and I alpha I purified from human serum showed that the TSG-6/I alpha I complex is rapidly formed even in the apparent absence of other proteins at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. The TSG-6/I alpha I complex was cleaved by chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase, suggesting that cross-linking by chondroitin sulfate is required for the stability of the complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7554708|t|Effects of nabumetone on prostanoid biosynthesis in humans.
7554708|a|BACKGROUND: The active metabolite of the anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone has been characterized as a selective inhibitor of the inducible prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of eicosanoid biosynthesis after oral dosing with nabumetone in nine healthy subjects. METHODS: We measured the urinary excretion of products of platelet (11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 [TXB2]) and renal (prostaglandin IF2 alpha [PGF2 alpha]) arachidonate metabolism as in vivo indexes of the constitutive PGHS-1 pathway. Moreover, the production of TXB2 during whole blood clotting was assessed as an index of the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 ex vivo. RESULTS: At steady state, nabumetone (500 and 1000 mg daily for 7 days) was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TXB2 and serum TXB2 levels by approximately 50% to 70%. However, the drug did not significantly affect the urinary excretion of PGF2 alpha. After discontinuation of nabumetone, urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion and whole blood TXB2 production returned to predrug levels with a similar timecourse that was consistent with the elimination half-life of its active metabolite. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin (40 mg), a selective inhibitor of platelet PGHS-1, caused a cumulative inhibition of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and whole blood TXB2 production that recovered with a timecourse consistent with platelet turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Nabumetone does dose-dependently inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 of healthy subjects both in vivo and ex vivo. Thus it is unlikely that its safety profile in patients may be related to selective inhibition of the inducible PGHS-2.

7601910|t|Altered gene expression in murine branchial arches following in utero exposure to retinoic acid.
7601910|a|Retinoic acid (RA) in the form of isotretinoin (Accutane) and tretinoin (Retin-A) is a clinically important compound in the treatment of dermatologic disorders. However, it is also a potent teratogen associated with a number of serious congenital malformations. Generally, these malformations involve the craniofacial structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. To determine how altered gene expression may contribute to the observed RA-induced defects, pregnant LM/Bc mice were administered (5 mg/kg) all-trans RA on gestational day (GD) 8:12. First and second branchial arches were removed from control and teratogen-treated embryos on GD 10:00 10:12, or 12:00, processed by in situ transcription/aRNA techniques, and analyzed for alterations in gene expression. In these studies, a panel of 40 candidate genes that are known to be important in mammalian craniofacial development were examined. This analysis revealed significant differences in the expression level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha (NAChR), transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2), type 1 cellular retinoid binding protein (CRBP-1), retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR gamma), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The alterations observed in the expression of these genes following RA exposure may prohibit normal morphogenetic processes within the second branchial arch and lead to the observed malformations.

7703721|t|Estramustine binding protein in primary tumours and metastases of malignant melanoma.
7703721|a|The presence of estramustine binding protein (EMBP), a 54 kD cytosolic glycoprotein, which is distinct from the estrogen receptor, was investigated in a pilot study of primary malignant melanomas and their metastases. In 11 primary melanomas EMBP was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of positive melanoma cells ranged between 11-91% with a mean of 57%. Radioimmunoassay on metastatic tissue revealed significant amounts of EMBP, with values ranging between 0.6-4.2 with a mean of 1.6 ng/mg protein. A high number of cells with a positive stain for EMBP in the primary tumours was significantly correlated to a short interval between diagnosis and the occurrence of metastases. Presence of EMBP in malignant melanoma may have prognostic significance and the role of hormone-linked cytostatic drugs in the treatment of this disease needs further investigation.

7714410|t|Preclinical efficacy of emedastine, a potent, selective histamine H1 antagonist for topical ocular use.
7714410|a|Emedastine [1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-2-(4-methyl-1-homopiperazinyl)- benzimidazole difumarate] was evaluated for topical ocular anti-histaminic activity in histamine and antigen stimulated conjunctivitis models.

Comparisons of relative potency 30 min post dosing between emedastine and other anti-histamines demonstrated that emedastine is equipotent to ketotifen, and 7, 7, 10, 10, 100, 357, 3333, and 5813 times more potent than brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, pyrilamine, levocabastine, pheniramine, diphenhydramine, and antazoline, respectively. Emedastine (0.1%) failed to significantly attenuate either serotonin or platelet-activating-factor induced vascular permeability changes indicating high selectivity for the histamine H1 receptor. In a passive conjunctival anaphylaxis model in guinea pigs, significant inhibition of the allergic response was observed following topical ocular administration of emedastine 5 min or 30 min prior to antigen challenge (ED50s 0.0046% and 0.00022%, respectively). These data clearly indicate that emedastine has potential as a topical ocular anti-histamine for treating allergic conjunctivitis.

7756657|t|ALL-1 gene rearrangements in DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor-related leukemia in children.
7756657|a|We examined clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic features and ALL-1 (MLL, Htrxl, HRX) gene rearrangements in 17 cases of secondary leukemia that occurred 11 months to 9 years from diagnoses of primary cancers in children who received topoisomerase II inhibitors or developed secondary leukemias typical of those associated with this therapy. Primary diagnoses included nine solid tumors and eight leukemias. Ten secondary leukemias were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one was of mixed lineage, two were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and four presented as myelodysplasia. Of 15 cases with 11q23 involvement, 11 (73%) were cytogenetically identifiable; four cases had molecular rearrangement only. By Southern blot, rearrangements within the ALL-1 gene were similar to sporadic cases. The results of this analysis suggest the following: (1) In most pediatric cases of topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated leukemia, there is disruption of the breakpoint cluster region of the ALL-1 gene at chromosomal band 11q23. (2) Exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 leukemia, as the only topoisomerase II inhibitor was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no topoisomerase II inhibitor was administered. (3) There is clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular heterogeneity in pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia. (4) There are some survivors of pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia, but the outcome is most often fatal.

7825862|t|Interactions of PGH synthase isozymes-1 and -2 with NSAIDs.
7825862|a|There are two isozymes of prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase (cyclooxygenase) called PGH synthase-1 and -2 or COX I and II. Both isozymes catalyze the same two reactions: oxygenation of arachidonate to yield PGG2 and reduction of PGG2 to PGH2. PGH synthase-1 is expressed constitutively and is found in most tissues. PGH synthase-2 is undetectable in most cells but can be induced in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, ovarian follicles, and macrophages by various mitogens, cytokines, and tumor promoters. PGH synthase-1 (PGHS-1) has been presumed to be the site of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the discovery of the second isozyme, PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-2), and its association with inflammation has suggested that this latter enzyme may be the therapeutic target of NSAIDs functioning in their antiinflammatory capacities. We have cloned cDNAs for murine PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, expressed these enzymes in cos-1 cells, and compared the relative sensitivities of the two isozymes to some common NSAIDs. Indomethacin, piroxicam, and sulindac sulfide were found to preferentially inhibit PGHS-1. Ibuprofen and meclofenamate inhibit both enzymes with comparable potencies. 6-Methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, the active metabolite of Relafen, inhibits murine PGHS-2 preferentially. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PGHS-1, preventing this isozyme from forming PGH2 or any other oxygenated product; in contrast, aspirin treatment of PGHS-2 causes this enzyme to form 15-hydroxy-5c,8c,11c,13t-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) instead of PGH2. Our results indicate mouse PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are pharmacologically distinct. Thus, it should be possible to develop agents highly selective for each PGHS isozyme. PGHS-2 is not expressed in stomach but is increased by inflammatory cytokines in cells such as macrophages. Thus, a selective inhibitor of PGHS-2 could be an antiinflammatory agent but without being ulcerogenic.

7902561|t|Neurochemical mechanism of action of anorectic drugs.
7902561|a|Studies with dexfenfluramine, an anorectic agent which releases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from nerve terminals and inhibits its reuptake, have considerably increased our knowledge of the role of 5-HT in feeding control. 5-HT1B receptors mediate the satiating effect of dexfenfluramine, whereas the mechanism by which 5-HT uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline cause anorexia is not clear. Anorexia induced by (+)-amphetamine, phentermine, diethylpropion and phenylpropanolamine seems to be the result of their ability to increase the release of noradrenaline and/or dopamine from nerve terminals and inhibit their reuptake or, in the case of phenylpropanolamine, to stimulate directly alpha 1-adrenoceptors. It has been suggested that beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors and D1 dopamine receptors are involved in their effect on food intake. The difficulties of extrapolation across species limit our knowledge of the mechanism of the anorectic action in humans. Significant advances in the treatment of feeding pathology will be linked to identifying new receptor types and subtypes for neurotransmitters and quantifying and modelling eating disorders such as binge-eating and food craving.

8032658|t|Further characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (putative 5-HT2B) in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle.
8032658|a|1. The present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize pharmacologically homogeneous populations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors from a possible mixed receptor population mediating concentration of the longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. Our aim was to extend the pharmacological characterization of the 5-HT2B receptor which is reported to be expressed in this preparation. 2. To minimize spontaneous activity and any influence of circular muscle on the contractile response, narrow (1-1.5 x 20 mm) segments of mucosa-denuded longitudinal muscle were used. Under these conditions, blockade of monoamine oxidase with pargyline (100 microM for 15 min) caused a leftward displacement of concentration-effect curves for both 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T) and tryptamine. Neither pargyline nor a number of uptake inhibitors affected responses to 5-HT. 3. In pargyline pretreated preparations, the order of potency of a number of tryptamine analogues was as follows: 5-MeO-T > or = alpha-Me-5-HT > or = 5-HT > 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) > tryptamine > 2-Me-5-HT. In addition several ligands known to act as agonists at either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors including 1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), Ru 24969, MK 212 and SCH 23390 were also agonists in rat fundus whilst sumatriptan, renzapride and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were very weak or inactive. With the exception of 2-Me-5-HT and m-CPP, most agonists produced monophasic concentration-effect curves consistent with an interaction at a single site. High concentrations of 2-Me-5-HT evoked relaxations which were blocked by phentolamine (1 MicroM) suggesting an interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors. m-CPP often evoked biphasic concentration-effect curves with a second contractile phase which was insensitive to yohimbine at concentrations higher than required for antagonism of responses to 5-HT.4. LY 53857, methiothepin, methysergide, ritanserin and ICI 170809 were potent but non-surmountable antagonists of 5-HT in rat fundus. In contrast, several ligands behaved as surmountable antagonists with the following order of potency: rauwolscine >yohimbine = mesulergine > mianserin = SB 204070 >WY 26703 > SB 200646> pirenpirone> renzapride. DAU 6285, granisetron, spiperone, ketanserin,phentolamine and GR 127935 did not affect responses to 5-HT at concentrations up to 1 pM. The agonist and concentration independent profile of antagonism supported a single site interaction for both agonists and antagonists.5. We conclude that despite small differences concerning the enantiomeric selectivity and affinity of rauwolscine and yohimbine, the close pharmacological identity of 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus and the recently cloned 5-HT2B receptor is maintained. SB 200646, which demonstrates some selectivity for 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus, should provide a useful ligand for confirmation of this view and allow discrimination of 5-HT2B function both in vitro and in vivo.

8150771|t|Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
8150771|a|Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

8294418|t|Phorbol esters and norepinephrine destabilize alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells.
8294418|a|The mechanism by which norepinephrine (NE) down-regulates alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor (alpha-AR) mRNA was studied in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. NE, phorbol esters, and bradykinin each decreased alpha-AR mRNA levels by 70-80%. The protein kinase C inhibitor (+)-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7) abolished the effects of phorbol esters and NE and decreased basal mRNA levels by 52 +/- 3%. Neither ryanodine nor EGTA inhibited down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA by NE. Actinomycin D caused alpha-AR mRNA level to decrease with a half-life of 3.2 +/- 0.4 h and blocked the effect of H-7 to decrease basal alpha-AR mRNA level. Both NE and phorbol esters increased the rate of alpha-AR mRNA degradation. In NE-desensitized cells, phorbol esters and bradykinin each caused the expected down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid prolonged the normally transient effect of NE for at least 24 h. We conclude that protein kinase C exerts two opposing effects on alpha-AR mRNA levels, 1) a decrease in the stability of the mRNA that requires the sustained phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate and 2) a permissive effect on alpha-AR gene transcription.

8384716|t|Molecular cloning and functional expression of 5-HT1E-like rat and human 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor genes.
8384716|a|Sequential polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to amplify a unique sequence representing a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor from rat hypothalamic cDNA. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved amino acids from transmembrane domains III, V, and VI of known receptors [5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, and 5-HT2; 5-HT is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)] were used as primers for the sequential reactions. The resulting product was subcloned and used to screen a rat genomic library to identify a full-length clone (MR77) containing an intronless open reading frame encoding a 366-amino acid seven-transmembrane domain protein. The human homolog was isolated, and its encoded protein had 93% overall amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Within the conserved transmembrane domains, the sequences exhibit approximately 52%, 59%, 65%, and 68% amino acid identity with the known rat 5-HT1A, rat 5-HT1B, rat 5-HT1D, and human 5-HT1E receptors, respectively. MR77 was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector system and expressed in CosM6 cells. Studies on broken cell preparations indicate that the expressed receptor exhibits 125I-labeled d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding that can be displaced by serotonin but not by other biogenic amines. The specific binding is displaced by the selective 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan but not by the mixed 5-HT1A/1D agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine. 125I-labeled LSD binding was competitively antagonized by the ergot alkaloids methysergide and ergotamine. HeLa cells transfected with the MR77 gene exhibited inhibition of adenylate cyclase in response to serotonin. MR77 is expressed at low levels throughout the brain, with the greatest expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. MR77 thus represents a 5-HT receptor of the 5-HT1 class, and we propose that, based on the pharmacological characterization, MR77 represents an additional 5-HT1E-like receptor.

8425287|t|Response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated ventricular tachycardia to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine. Evidence for myocardial receptor-mediated effects.
8425287|a|BACKGROUND: Reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) is known to be insensitive to the nucleoside adenosine. However, we have previously identified a form of nonreentrant, catecholamine-mediated VT that can be initiated with rapid pacing, demonstrates cycle length dependence, and is sensitive to exogenous adenosine as well as to the Valsalva maneuver. The mechanism of this tachycardia is thought to be due to a catecholamine-induced, cAMP-mediated increase in intracellular calcium, resulting in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. The antiarrhythmic effects of exogenous adenosine and Valsalva on this form of VT may be due to receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or to noncardiac receptor-mediated effects, i.e., exogenous adenosine may modulate VT through alterations in autonomic tone by activation of arterial chemoreceptors, and Valsalva has been shown to decrease venous return, resulting in a reduction in cardiac dimensions and myocardial stretch. To clarify this issue and circumvent both autonomic and noncardiac receptor effects, the response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated VT to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Group 1 (n = 8): Dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg i.v.), a nucleoside transport blocker that potentiates the effects of endogenous adenosine, reproducibly abolished sustained nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated VT in the five patients in whom it was evaluated. VT recurred with the addition of aminophylline, a competitive adenosine A1-receptor antagonist. Edrophonium (10 mg i.v.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates the effects of acetylcholine at the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, terminated VT in four of four patients, an effect that was reversed by atropine. Group 2 (n = 6): In patients with reentrant VT, dipyridamole and edrophonium had no effect on VT cycle length or duration. Group 3 (n = 4): Adenosine and vagal maneuvers had no effect on catecholamine-mediated VT caused by automaticity in three of four patients tested. In one patient, adenosine transiently suppressed VT (< 5 seconds), after which it spontaneously resumed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study further delineate the mechanism of a newly recognized form of clinical VT. It can be identified by termination of the tachycardia in response to activation of the adenosine A1 or muscarinic cholinergic receptor, which results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase. These receptor-mediated effects appear to be specific for identifying nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated VT.

8566141|t|Amantadine induces c-fos in rat striatum: reversal with dopamine D1 and NMDA receptor antagonists.
8566141|a|Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) induced Fos expression in the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of the striatum. The distribution pattern of Fos induced by amantadine was more similar to those seen with dopaminomimetics than with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocked amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum. However, amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum was unaffected by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride. These results suggest that amantadine induction of Fos in the rat striatum is related to dopamine D1 and NMDA receptors.

8697470|t|[Inactivated factor VII exercises a powerful antithrombotic activity in an experimental model of recurrent arterial thrombosis].
8697470|a|The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated when tissue factor (TF) is exposed as a consequence of arterial damage. TF binds to factor VII (FVII) or activated FVII (FVIIa), generating a complex that activates both FX and FIX, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. To determine whether inhibition of FVII binding to TF would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular thrombus formation. In addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular thrombus formation, recombinant human FVIIa was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits. Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent thrombus formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (Folt's model). Carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor. CFVs were induced in 29 New Zealand White rabbits. After CFVs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26G) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant FVIIai (0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TF (0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus); 7 animals received ridogrel, a dual thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of platelet glycoprotein Ib/von Willebrand factor interaction (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus). FVIIai abolished CFVs in 5 of 5 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). AP-1 abolished CFVs in 7 of 9 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). Finally, in all the animals receiving ridogrel or ATA CFVs were abolished (CFV frequency 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline in both groups). Thirty minutes following inhibition of CFVs, in the FVIIai treated rabbits, human recombinant FVIIa was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min. In the other three groups, FVIIa, at the same dose, was infused i.v. Infusion of FVIIa restored CFVs in all FVIIai treated animals and in 6 of 7 AP-1 treated animals, thus indicating that AP-1 and FVIIai bindings to TF was competitive and was replaced by FVIIa. Infusion of FVIIa failed to restore CFVs in ridogrel e ATA treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by FVIIa was overcome by inhibition of platelet function. Activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to ADP and thrombin, were not different after FVIIai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values. Thus, FVII-VIIa plays an important role in initiating thrombus formation in vivo. Administration of FVIIai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation. In addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in arterial thrombosis, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore thrombus formation.

8710929|t|Norepinephrine transporters have channel modes of conduction.
8710929|a|Neurotransmitter transporters couple to existing ion gradients to achieve reuptake of transmitter into presynaptic terminals. For coupled cotransport, substrates and ions cross the membrane in fixed stoichiometry. This is in contrast to ion channels, which carry an arbitrary number of ions depending on the channel open time. Members of the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter gene family presumably function with fixed stoichiometry in which a set number of ions cotransport with one transmitter molecule. Here we report channel-like events from a presumably fixed stoichiometry [norepinephrine (NE)+, Na+, and Cl-], human NE (hNET) in the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter gene family. These events are stimulated by NE and by guanethidine, an hNET substrate, and they are blocked by cocaine and the antidepressant desipramine. Voltage-clamp data combined with NE uptake data from these same cells indicate that hNETs have two functional modes of conduction: a classical transporter mode (T-mode) and a novel channel mode (C-mode). Both T-mode and C-mode are gated by the same substrates and antagonized by the same blockers. T-mode is putatively electrogenic because the transmitter and cotransported ions sum to one net charge. However, C-mode carries virtually all of the transmitter-induced current, even though it occurs with low probability. This is because each C-mode opening transports hundreds of charges per event. The existence of a channel mode of conduction in a previously established fixed-stoichiometry transporter suggests the appearance of an aqueous pore through the transporter protein during the transport cycle and may have significance for transporter regulation.

8733007|t|Mineralocorticoids, salt, hypertension: effects on the heart.
8733007|a|In uninephrectomized rats on 1% NaCl solution to drink, aldosterone (0.75 micrograms/h subcutaneously for 8 weeks) raises blood pressure and causes marked interstitial and perivascular cardiac fibrosis, effects not seen in animals on a low salt intake. In extending these initial findings, we have shown that cardiac fibrosis (i) is not reversed by correction of mineralocorticoid-induced hypokalemia; (ii) appears not to involve the plasma or tissue renin-angiotensin systems, as fibrosis is largely unaffected by concurrent administration of Losartan or Perindopril; (iii) is independent of cardiac hypertrophy, in that it is equally seen in right and left ventricles, and in rats rendered hypertensive without cardiac hypertrophy by the administration of 9 alpha-fluorocortisol; (iv) is independent of elevated blood pressure, in that it is found in normotensive animals infused peripherally with aldosterone and intracerebroventricularly with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist RU28318; (v) is via classical MR, in that it is blocked by concurrent administration of the MR antagonist potassium canrenoate; and (vi) may or may not be a direct cardiac effect, inasmuch as data for in vivo effects on collagen formation by cardiac fibroblasts are conflicting. Although there is a high probability that the action of aldosterone to cause cardiac fibrosis in this experimental model is an effect via non-epithelial MR, the locus of aldosterone action remains to be established, as do the molecular mechanisms linking MR occupancy by aldosterone and collagen deposition. In addition, and in particular, the mechanisms underlying the crucial contribution of high salt intake in this model of mineralocorticoid excess await exploration.

8740147|t|Amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 and potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase in perfused lungs of rats.
8740147|a|Previous studies have resulted in the classification of amezinium as a selective inhibitor of neuronal monoamine oxidase (MAO), because it is a much more potent MAO inhibitor in intact tissues, in which it is accumulated in noradrenergic neurones by uptake1, than in tissue homogenates. In the present study, the effects of amezinium on the deamination of noradrenaline were investigated in intact lungs of rats, since the pulmonary endothelial cells are a site where the catecholamine transporter is non-neuronal uptake1. In addition, another drug that is both a substrate of uptake1 and a MAO inhibitor, debrisoquine, was investigated in the study. The first aim of the study was to show whether amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 in rat lungs. After loading of isolated perfused lungs with 3H-noradrenaline (MAO and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibited), the efflux of 3H-noradrenaline was measured for 30 min. When 1 mumol/l amezinium or 15 mumol/l debrisoquine was added for the last 15 min of efflux, there was a rapid and marked increase in the fractional rate of loss of 3H-noradrenaline, which was reduced by about 70% when 1 mumol/l desipramine was present throughout the efflux period. These results showed that both drugs were substrates for uptake1 in rat lungs. In lungs perfused with 1 nmol/l 3H-noradrenaline (COMT inhibited), 10, 30 and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused 58%, 76% and 74% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively, and 30, 300 and 3000 nmol/l debrisoquine caused 56%, 89% and 96% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively. When MAO-B was also inhibited, 10 nmol/l amezinium caused 84% inhibition of the deamination of noradrenaline by MAO-A in the lungs. In contrast, in hearts perfused with 10 nmol/l 3H-noradrenaline under conditions where the amine was accumulated by uptake2 (COMT, uptake1 and vesicular transport inhibited), 10 nmol/l amezinium had no effect and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused only 36% inhibition of deamination of noradrenaline. The results when considered with previous reports in the literature show that amezinium is about 1000 times more potent and debrisoquine is about 20 times more potent for MAO inhibition in rat lungs than in tissue homogenates, and the reason for their high potencies in the intact lungs is transport and accumulation of the drugs in the pulmonary endothelial cells by uptake1. Amezinium is much less potent as a MAO inhibitor in cells with the uptake2 transporter, such as the myocardial cells of the heart. The results also confirmed previous reports that amezinium is highly selective for MAO-A.

8836617|t|Role of tachykinin and bradykinin receptors and mast cells in gaseous formaldehyde-induced airway microvascular leakage in rats.
8836617|a|We have investigated the effects of CP-99,994 [(+)-(2s,3s)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine], a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, and ketotifen (4-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)4 H-benzo[4,5]cycloheptal[1,2-b]thiophen-10(9H)-one hydrogen fumarate), a histamine H1 receptor antagonist with mast cell-stabilizing properties, on microvascular leakage induced by gaseous formaldehyde. Extravasation of Evans blue dye into airway tissues was used as an index of airway microvascular leakage. Leakage of dye in the trachea and main bronchi increased significantly in a concentration-dependent fashion after 10 min inhalation of formaldehyde (5-45 parts per million (ppm)). The airway response induced by 10 min inhalation of 15 ppm formaldehyde (trachea: 119.5 +/- 13.9 ng/mg, n = 7; main bronchi: 139.6 +/- 7.9 ng/mg, n = 7) was abolished by the administration of CP-99,994 (3 and 6 mg/kg i.v.), but not by the administration of HOE 140 (0.65 mg/kg i.v.) nor ketotifen (1 mg/kg i.v.). The increase in vascular permeability induced by formaldehyde in the rat airway was mediated predominantly by NK1 receptor stimulation. Activation of bradykinin receptors and mast cells did not appear to play an important role in this airway response.

9486667|t|Molecular determinants of dofetilide block of HERG K+ channels.
9486667|a|The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes a K+ channel with biophysical properties nearly identical to the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr). HERG/IKr channels are a prime target for the pharmacological management of arrhythmias and are selectively blocked by class III antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs, such as dofetilide, E4031, and MK-499, at submicromolar concentrations. By contrast, the closely related bovine ether-a-go-go channel (BEAG) is 100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide. To identify the molecular determinants for dofetilide block, we first engineered chimeras between HERG and BEAG and then used site-directed mutagenesis to localize single amino acid residues responsible for block. Using constructs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found that transplantation of the S5-S6 linker from BEAG into HERG removed high-affinity block by dofetilide. A point mutation in the S5-S6 linker region, HERG S620T, abolished high-affinity block and interfered with C-type inactivation. Thus, our results indicate that important determinants of dofetilide binding are localized to the pore region of HERG. Since the loss of high-affinity drug binding was always correlated with a loss of C-type inactivation, it is possible that the changes observed in drug binding are due to indirect allosteric modifications in the structure of the channel protein and not to the direct interaction of dofetilide with the respective mutated site chains. However, the chimeric approach was not able to identify domains outside the S5-S6 linker region of the HERG channel as putative candidates involved in drug binding. Moreover, the reverse mutation BEAG T432S increased the affinity of BEAG K+ channels for dofetilide, whereas C-type inactivation could not be recovered. Thus, the serine in position HERG 620 may participate directly in dofetilide binding; however, an intact C-type inactivation process seems to be crucial for high-affinity drug binding.

9525919|t|Identification of binding sites for bepridil and trifluoperazine on cardiac troponin C.
9525919|a|The solution structure of cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (Sia, S., Li, M. X., Spyracopoulos, L., Gagne, S. M., Liu, W., Putkey, J. A. & Sykes, B. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18216-18221) challenges existing structure/function models for this critical regulatory protein. For example, it is clear that the closed conformation of the regulatory N-terminal domain in Ca2+-bound cardiac troponin C (cTnC) presents a much different binding surface for Ca2+-sensitizing compounds than previously thought. We report here the use of Met methyl groups as site-specific structural markers to identify drug binding sites for trifluoperazine and bepridil on cTnC. Drug dependent changes in the NMR heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra of [methyl-13C]Met-labeled cTnC indicate that bepridil and trifluoperazine bind to similar sites but only in the presence of Ca2+. There are 3-4 drug binding sites in the N- and C-terminal domains of intact cTnC that exhibit fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Use of a novel spin-labeled phenothiazine and detection of isotope-filtered nuclear Overhauser effects allowed identification of drug binding sites in the shallow hydrophobic cup in the C-terminal domain and on two hydrophobic surfaces on the N-terminal regulatory domain. The data presented here, coupled with our previous study using covalent blocking groups, support a model in which the Ca2+-sensitizing binding site includes Met-45 in helix B of site I, and Met-60 and -80 in helices B and C of the regulatory site II. This subregion in cTnC makes a likely target against which to design new and selective Ca2+-sensitizing compounds.

9596079|t|Peripheral blood mononuclear cells express mutated NCCT mRNA in Gitelman's syndrome: evidence for abnormal thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransport.
9596079|a|Genetic analysis has demonstrated complete linkage between the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene (NCCT or TSC) and Gitelman's syndrome (GS). Several genomic NCCT mutations have been reported. This study was performed to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) express NCCT mRNA and whether defective PBMC NaCl cotransport could be demonstrated in GS. PBMC were isolated from two brothers with GS, their parents, and healthy control subjects. Northern analysis revealed that NCCT mRNA is expressed in PBMC. The sequence of full-length NCCT cDNA amplified from normal PBMC was identical to human renal NCCT cDNA. Two different mutations were detected in the patients' NCCT cDNA (compound heterozygote). In cDNA derived from the patient's maternal allele, exon 24 was deleted, resulting in a premature stop codon (after amino acid 920). cDNA derived from the patient's paternal allele had an additional 119-bp insertion between exons 3 and 4, generating a premature stop codon (after amino acid 187). The patient's genomic DNA had a previously described 5' splice site mutation in intron 24, GGT --> GTT (maternal allele), and a new 3' splice site mutation in intron 3, CAG --> CAA (paternal allele), which resulted in the activation of a nearby cryptic splice site in intron 3. The latter mutation was not present in 300 normal chromosomes. To determine the functional significance of these findings, chlorothiazide-inhibitable 22Na uptake was measured in PBMC from control subjects, the parents, and the patients with GS in the presence of bumetanide. In control PBMC, chlorothiazide inhibited 22Na uptake by approximately 9%. PBMC from the two patients with GS failed to respond to chlorothiazide. These results demonstrate that PBMC can be used for mutational analysis of NCCT mRNA in patients with GS. Furthermore, functional evidence is provided that the underlying cause of GS is defective NCCT NaCl cotransport.

9631585|t|A case of therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia with t(16;21)(q24;q22) after chemotherapy with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and the alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide.
9631585|a|A 59-year-old female suffering from malignant lymphoma developed therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (t-AML) after chemotherapy consisting of treatment with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. The cumulative dose of etoposide administration was 5500 mg; 1500 mg given intravenously and 4000 mg orally. One year later, she suddenly developed AML of FAB M2. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed deletion of 7q and a rare translocation, t(16;21)(q24;q22). Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the AML1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving AML1 gene and chromosome 16. These results suggest that the breakpoint is not located in the breakpoint cluster region for t(8;21). The patient was treated with chemotherapy and entered complete remission.

9673855|t|Safety of selegiline (deprenyl) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
9673855|a|Selegiline (deprenyl), a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) is widely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. As the first MAO-B inhibitor approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, concerns were raised about the safety of the drug based on the adverse effect profiles of older, nonselective MAO inhibitors. Unlike the nonselective MAO inhibitors, selegiline does not significantly potentiate tyramine-induced hypertension (the 'cheese effect') at the dosages (5 to 10 mg daily) used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline has been well tolerated when given alone. The most frequent adverse events seen during monotherapy have been insomnia, nausea, benign cardiac arrhythmias, dizziness and headache. When combined with levodopa, selegiline can potentiate the typical adverse effects of levodopa, if the dose of levodopa is not reduced sufficiently. Thus, the most common adverse effects associated with this combination are nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation and insomnia. At the later stages of Parkinson's disease when fluctuations in disability occur, peak dose dyskinesias, psychiatric complications like hallucinations and insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension are further potentiated by selegiline. Mortality was recently reported to be increased when selegiline and levodopa were given together in comparison with treatment with levodopa alone, but a large meta-analysis of 5 long term studies and 4 separate studies did not support this conclusion. Selegiline seems to be generally well tolerated in combination with other drugs. However, when pethidine (meperidine) has been given to patients who are receiving selegiline therapy, severe adverse effects have been reported. Thus, the concomitant use of these drugs is not recommended. A low tyramine diet is recommended if selegiline is used together with nonselective MAO inhibitors or the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide. Several adverse effects have been reported when fluoxetine and selegiline have been used together. A recent survey revealed that the incidence of a true serotonin syndrome is, however, very low with this combination. Concomitant use of selegiline and other selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram, which have generally less interactions than fluoxetine, seems to be well tolerated. Nevertheless, caution is advised when combining a SSRI or a tricyclic antidepressant and selegiline.

9710435|t|Ibuprofen inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl- secretion.
9710435|a|We evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion (Isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. In T84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent Isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent Ki of 142 microM. Salicylic acid inhibited Isc with an apparent Ki of 646 microM. We determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated Isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (MTE) and human bronchial epithelia (HBE). Similar to our results in T84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microM) inhibited the forskolin-induced Isc in MTEs and HBEs by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. Nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical Cl- (ICl) and basolateral K+ (IK) currents after stimulation by forskolin. After forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microM) reduced both the ICl and IK; reducing ICl and IK by 60 and 15%, respectively. To determine whether this inhibition of ICl was due to the inhibition of CFTR, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from L-cells were evaluated. Ibuprofen (300 microM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pA to 0.59+/-0.04 pA (n = 3). Similarly, salicylic acid (3 mM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pA to 0.48+/-0.06 pA (n = 4). Based on these results, we conclude that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of CFTR Cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane K+ channels. This may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase CFTR expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.

9832994|t|Antagonism of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced inhibition of exploratory activity in an emergence procedure, the open field test, in rats.
9832994|a|The effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) were studied on exploratory behaviour in the open field test, using a procedure designed to evaluate the emergence of rats into a novel environment. mCPP reduced the exploratory activity in a dose-related manner after subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration. The inhibition was manifest in all the parameters used to quantify the exploration of the open field area. Additional neuroendocrine experiments in a parallel group of rats revealed a dose-related increase in plasma prolactin and ACTH levels after i.v. mCPP, pointing to a general state of arousal in these mCPP-treated animals. A number of 5-HT antagonists were tested for their ability to prevent or reverse the behavioural inhibition induced by an i.v. injection of 1.0 g/kg mCPP given 15 min before testing in the open field. The antagonists were injected s.c. or given orally at various time intervals before mCPP, or they were injected i.v. 10 min after mCPP. The lowest active doses for the attentuation of the mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition after s.c., oral and i.v. administration, respectively, were 0.04, 40 and 10 mg/kg for pizotifen; 0.16, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for mianserin; 0.63, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for methysergide, and 0.16, 2.5 and 2.5 mg/kg for ritanserin. The lowest active doses of mirtazapine after s.c. and i.v. treatment were 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. These data indicate that mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as pizotifen and methysergide, and mixed 5-HT and catecholamine antagonists such as mianserin and mirtazapine are more potent antagonists of mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition in rats than the more selective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist ritanserin.

9851542|t|Pressor and bradycardic effects of tacrine and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the rat.
9851542|a|The cardiovascular effects of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine, tacrine and rivastigmine injected by intravenous (i.v.) route were compared in freely moving Wistar rats. The three drugs significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate. Compared to physostigmine, a 20-fold higher dose of tacrine and a 40-fold higher dose of rivastigmine was necessary to induce a comparable pressor effect. Tacrine was chosen as a model to study the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of i.v. cholinesterase inhibitors. Atropine totally abolished while methylatropine did not affect tacrine pressor effects. Conversely, both drugs abolished tacrine-induced bradycardia. The alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin partially but significantly reduced tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly. The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (ID50 = 31.19 microg). Central injection of such muscarinic receptor antagonists did not affect tacrine-induced bradycardia. Our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic M2 receptors inducing a secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release. Conversely, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced bradycardia appears to be mediated by peripheral muscarinic mechanisms.

9876137|t|State-dependent cocaine block of sodium channel isoforms, chimeras, and channels coexpressed with the beta1 subunit.
9876137|a|Cocaine block of human cardiac (hH1) and rat skeletal (mu1) muscle sodium channels was examined under whole-cell voltage clamp in transiently transfected HEK293t cells. Low affinity block of resting mu1 and hH1 channels at -180 mV was the same, and high affinity block of inactivated channels at -70 mV was the same. Cocaine block of hH1 channels was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block. We induced shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation at mu1 and hH1 channels by constructing mu1/hH1 channel chimeras or by coexpressing the wild-type channels with the rat brain beta1 subunit. In contrast to several previous reports, coexpression of the rat brain beta1 subunit with mu1 or hH1 produced large positive shifts in steady-state inactivation. Shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation elicited linear shifts in steady-state cocaine block, yet these manipulations did not affect the cocaine affinity of resting or inactivated channels. These data, as well as simulations used to predict block, indicate that state-dependent cocaine block depends on both steady-state inactivation and channel activation, although inactivation appears to have the predominant role.
